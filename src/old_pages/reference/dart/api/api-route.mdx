# Dart - api.route()

Creates a new route (path) within an API.

```dart
import 'package:nitric_sdk/nitric.dart';

final customersRoute = Nitric.api("public").route("/customers");
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  <Property name="match" required type="String">
    The path matcher to use for this route. Calling `route` on the same API more
    than once with the same matcher will return the same route object. Matchers
    accept path parameters in the form of a colon prefixed string. The string
    provided will be used as that path parameter's name when calling middleware
    and handlers.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Examples

### Create a route

```dart
import 'package:nitric_sdk/nitric.dart';

final customersRoute = Nitric.api("public").route("/customers");
```

### Create a route with path params

Route paths can include dynamic parameters. These values will automatically be parsed and provided in the context object for your middleware and handlers as a `string`.

For example, if you have a customers path and you want to include a `customerId` param you would define the route like this.

```dart
import 'package:nitric_sdk/nitric.dart';

final customersRoute = Nitric.api("public").route("/customers/:customerId");
```
