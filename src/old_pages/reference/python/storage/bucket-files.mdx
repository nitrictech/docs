# Python - bucket.files()

Get a list of file references for files that exist on the bucket.

```python
from nitric.resources import bucket
from nitric.application import Nitric

assets = bucket('assets').allow('read')

files = await assets.files()

Nitric.run()
```

> Earlier versions of the Nitric SDK used 'reading'. The latest version uses 'read'.

## Examples

### Deleting all files in a bucket

```python
from nitric.resources import bucket
from nitric.application import Nitric

assets = bucket('assets').allow('read', 'delete')

files = await assets.files()
for f in files:
  await f.delete()

Nitric.run()
```

> Earlier versions of the Nitric SDK used 'reading' and 'deleting'. The latest version uses 'read' and 'delete'.

## Notes

This method returns a list of [File](./bucket-file) references that exist on the bucket.
