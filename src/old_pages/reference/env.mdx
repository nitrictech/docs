export const description = 'How to use Environment Variables in Nitric projects'

# Environment Variables

.env files can be used to configure properties such as runtime ids, API keys, etc.

<Note>
  If you're looking for more secure ways to store values you might consider the
  [secrets manager](/secrets) or an [object store](/storage).
</Note>

## What order are `.env` files loaded in?

When running `start`, `run` & `up` Nitric will automatically load your .env files in the following order.

1. .env
2. any file you pass in via "--env-file"

Values in the default .env are overwritten by additional env files.

## System Environment Variables

If you are running your project in the cloud, build, or the run environment, Nitric provides prefixed Environment Variables, which you can find in the table below.

| Name               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NITRIC_STACK_ID    | The Stack ID of the project. Example: `coolkat-gcp-4c0wg0hg`                                                                                                                                                                  |
| NITRIC_ENVIRONMENT | The Environment that the app is running on. The value can be either `cloud` (for deployed in the cloud), `run` (for stacks running in nitric run), or `build` (for stack code running during the deployment gathering phase). |
