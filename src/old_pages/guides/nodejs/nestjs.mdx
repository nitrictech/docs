# Nest.js integration with Nitric

## What we'll be doing

In this guide we will be creating a [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) application and deploying it to the cloud using the Nitric CLI.

The Nest.js application will be able to perform CRUD operations on user profiles that will interact with a key value store using the Nitric SDK.

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, here are things you'll need setup ahead of time:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- The [Nitric CLI](/getting-started/installation)
- An [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) account (_your choice_)

## Getting started

To get started we will download the Nest CLI.

```bash
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

We can then use the CLI to scaffold our Nest project.

```bash
nest new nest-x-nitric
```

This will create a src directory with the Nest application code and a test file.

## Adding a Profile controller

Within our src directory we want to replace the base App controller code with a Profile controller.

```typescript {{ label: 'profile/profile.controller.ts' }}
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common'
import { ProfileService } from './profile.service'

@Controller()
export class ProfileController {
  constructor(private readonly profileService: ProfileService) {}

  @Get()
  getProfile(): string {
    return this.profileService.getProfile()
  }
}
```

Then update the App service with the Profile service.

```typescript {{ label: 'profile/profile.service.ts' }}
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'

@Injectable()
export class ProfileService {
  getProfile(): string {
    return 'Hello World!'
  }
}
```

We will then need to update the imports for the base App module. We will keep this as the AppModule as its going to act as the entrypoint to our application.

```typescript {{ label: 'app.module.ts' }}
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { ProfileController } from './profile/profile.controller'
import { ProfileService } from './profile/profile.service'

@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [ProfileController],
  providers: [ProfileService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Creating the ProfileService

With that done, we can start creating some routes for interacting with our user profiles. We will be storing the profiles in a key value store which is handled by the Nitric SDK.

```bash
yarn add @nitric/sdk
```

Firstly, we will define our profiles [key value store](/keyvalue) and a Profile type at the top of our `ProfileService` file. The key value store will have permissions for getting, setting, and deleting as we will be using all those features for our Profile service.

```typescript {{ label: 'profile/profile.service.ts' }}
import { Injectable, NotFoundException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { kv } from '@nitric/sdk';

export interface Profile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const profiles = kv<Profile>('profiles').allow(
  'get',
  'set',
  'delete',
);

@Injectable()
export class ProfileService {
  ...
}
```

We can then create some handlers for creating profiles. This will accept a create profile request and return the newly created profile.

```typescript {{ label: 'profile/profile.service.ts' }}
@Injectable()
export class ProfileService {
  async createProfile(createProfileReq: Omit<Profile, 'id'>): Promise<Profile> {
    const id: string = uuidv4()

    const profile = { id, ...createProfileReq } as Profile

    await profiles.set(id, profile)

    return profile
  }
}
```

Our next handler will be getting an individual profile by its `id`. This will accept an `id` and will return either the found profile or throw a not found exception.

```typescript {{ label: 'profile/profile.service.ts' }}
@Injectable()
export class ProfileService {
  ...

  async getProfile(id: string): Promise<Profile> {
    const profile = await profiles.get(id);

    if (!profile) {
      throw new NotFoundException();
    }

    return profile;
  }
}
```

The final handler we will write is for deleting an individual profile by its `id`.

```typescript {{ label: 'profile/profile.service.ts' }}
@Injectable()
export class ProfileService {
  ...

  async deleteProfile(id: string): Promise<void> {
    await profiles.delete(id);
  }
}
```

## Adding Nitric

To run the application locally using Nitric, and to eventually deploy the application, we will need to create a `nitric.yaml` file. This contains the name of the project, and a file path to the main entrypoint to the application.

```yaml
name: nest-x-nitric
services:
  - match: src/main.ts
    start: yarn dev
```

We then want to add the `http` type to our main function, and pass in the Nest.js application. The `http` wrapper will use the `bootstrap` function when starting the application and pass it the port.

<Note>
  The application port will be set by the NITRIC_HTTP_PROXY_PORT environment
  variable, however it will find an open port if that environment variable isn't
  set.
</Note>

```typescript {{ label: 'app.module.ts' }}
import { http } from '@nitric/sdk'
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core'
import { AppModule } from './app.module'

async function bootstrap(port: number) {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule)
  return await app.listen(port)
}

http(bootstrap)
```

## Creating the ProfileController

Now that the service is built, we can use the `ProfileService` with our `ProfileController` routing. This involves correctly extracting the parameters from the request object to then pass into the services.

```typescript {{ label: 'profile/profile.controller.ts' }}
import { Controller, Get, Post, Delete, Param, Req } from '@nestjs/common'
import { Profile, ProfileService } from './profile.service'
import { Request } from 'express'

@Controller()
export class ProfileController {
  constructor(private readonly profileService: ProfileService) {}

  @Get('/profile/:id')
  async getProfile(@Param('id') id: string) {
    return await this.profileService.getProfile(id)
  }

  @Post('/profile')
  async createProfile(@Req() req: Request<Omit<Profile, 'id'>>) {
    return await this.profileService.createProfile(req.body)
  }

  @Delete('/profile/:id')
  async deleteProfile(@Param('id') id: string) {
    return await this.profileService.deleteProfile(id)
  }
}
```

## Test locally

We can test that this works by running `nitric start`.

```bash
nitric start
```

You can use any http client to test the application. The application will be running from a random port, but proxied on port 4001. It is important that http://localhost:4001 correctly wraps your application.

We can test that a create request works by using the following cURL command.

```
curl  -X POST \
  'http://localhost:4001/profile' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "name": "Peter Parker",
  "age": 17,
  "homeTown": "Queens, New York City"
}'
```

It should return something similar to this:

```json
{
  "id": "2cbaeaf5-9339-44c4-a396-606a0d3910d9",
  "name": "Peter Parker",
  "age": 17,
  "homeTown": "Queens, New York City"
}
```

Using that id we can then make a get request to get the profile (replace the `id` param with the `id` from above).

```
curl http://localhost:4001/profile/2cbaeaf5-9339-44c4-a396-606a0d3910d9
```

It should return:

```json
{
  "id": "2cbaeaf5-9339-44c4-a396-606a0d3910d9",
  "name": "Peter Parker",
  "age": 17,
  "homeTown": "Queens, New York City"
}
```

## Deploy to the cloud

If you're ready, you can deploy the application to AWS, Azure or Google Cloud.

The application code is ready to deploy as is, however a stack first needs to be defined. Stacks are essentially named deployment targets, which represent instances of your services running in the cloud.

You can create a new stack by running `nitric stack new` and following the prompts.

```bash
nitric stack new
```

Finally, run the `up` command to deploy the stack and push your code to the cloud:

```bash
nitric up
```

You can use the URL returned from the `up` command to make requests to your newly deployed application. If you want to make further changes to your application just run `nitric up` again and only the difference will be deployed.

When you're done with your application, you can destroy it using the command:

```bash
nitric down
```
