  'Using Queues and Topics for async messaging with Nitric'

# Messaging

Nitric provides two common options for asynchronous messaging. Topics for publish/subscribe messaging, where new messages are immediately _pushed_ to subscribers, and Queues for _pull_ messaging where new messages are put on a queue and must be requested.

Nitric provides unique names for specific message types. Messages sent to a _Topic_ are called _Events_, while messages sent to a _Queue_ are called _Tasks_. The structures of these messages are very similar, but the delivery and retry mechanisms are different. The unique naming removes ambiguity when working with these messages in code and makes their intention clear.

## Topics & Events

Topics and Events provide a scalable, decoupled, way to communicate between functions and containers.

### Topics

A topic is a named target where events can be published. They can be thought of as a subject that your functions can discuss with each other.

They're awesome for allowing serverless functions to communicate in a stateless, scalable and highly decoupled way.

### Events

Events are messages that can be published on a topic. They can be thought of as a notification that is sent to say that something new has happened. Events have the following properties:

<Properties>
  <Property name="id" type="string">
    Unique id to apply to the event. If an id isn't provided, a version 4 UUID
    will be auto-generated instead.
  </Property>
  <Property name="payload" required type="Map<string, any>">
    Payload to be sent with the event.
  </Property>
  <Property name="payloadType" type="string">
    The type of payload supplied.
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Subscriptions

A subscription is something that listens to a topic. You can think of it as a channel that notifies your application when something new arrives on the topic.

### Creating a Topic

Nitric allows you to define named topics. When defining topics, you can give the function permissions for publishing. If permissions are not specified, subscribers can be created.

Here's an example of how to create a topic with permissions to publish events.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { topic } from '@nitric/sdk'

const userCreatedTopic = topic('user-created').for('publishing')
```

```python
from nitric.resources import topic

user_created_topic = topic("user-created").allow("publishing")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Publishing an event

To send an event to a topic and notify all subscribers, use the `publish()` method on the topic reference. The function must have permissions to `publish` to the topic.

The below example publishes a message to a topic called `user-created`.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { topic } from '@nitric/sdk'

const userCreatedTopic = topic('user-created').for('publishing')

await userCreatedTopic.publish({
  payload: {
    email: 'new.user@example.com',
  },
})
```

```python
from nitric.resources import topic

user_created_topic = topic("user-created").allow("publishing")

# Both of these will publish the same event
await user_created_topic.publish({
	"email": "new.user@example.com"
})

await user_created_topic.publish({
	"payload": {
		"email": "new.user@example.com"
	}
})
```

</CodeGroup>

### Subscribing to a topic

To execute a function when new events are published you can set up subscribers. The delay between publishing an event and a subscriber being executed is usually only a few milliseconds. This makes subscribers perfect for responding to events as they happen.

The below code shows a subscription that responds to events when new users are created.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { topic } from '@nitric/sdk'

const userCreatedTopic = topic('user-created')

userCreatedTopic.subscribe(async (ctx) => {
  // Extract data from the event payload for processing
  const { email } = ctx.req.json()

  sendWelcomeEmail(email)
})
```

```python
from nitric.resources import topic

user_created_topic = topic("user-created")

@user_created_topic.subscribe()
async def updates_sub(ctx):
	email = ctx.req.json['email']

	send_welcome_email(email)
```

</CodeGroup>

### Limitations on Publishing and Subscribing

Nitric won't allow you to request publishing access and set up a subscriber in the same function.

The limitation exists to protect you from infinite loops in deployed functions where a function calls itself indirectly via a topic. These sorts of mistakes can lead to large unintentional cloud charges - something you probably want to avoid.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
// this is invalid
import { topic } from '@nitric/sdk'

const loopTopic = topic('infinite').for('publishing')

loopTopic.subscribe(async (ctx) => {
  await loopTopic.publish({ payload: {} })
})
```

```python
# this is invalid
from nitric.resources import topic

loop_topic = topic("infinite").allow("publishing")

@loop_topic.subscribe()
async def danger(ctx):
	await loop_topic.publish(dict())
```

</CodeGroup>

### Reliable event handling

If a subscriber encounters an error or is terminated before it finishes processing an event, what happens? Is the event lost?

Nitric deploys topics to cloud services that support "at-least-once delivery". Events are _usually_ delivered exactly once, in the same order that they're published. However, to prevent lost events, they're sometimes delivered more than once or out of order.

Typically, retries occur when a subscriber doesn't respond successfully, like when unhandled exceptions occur. You'll want to make sure events aren't processed again by accident or partially processed, leaving your system in an unexpected state.

Luckily, building atomic publishers and idempotent subscribers is enough to solve this.

**Atomic publishers**

Your publishers need to update your database _and_ publish associated events. If a database update fails, the events should _never_ be sent. If the database update succeeds, the events should _always_ publish. The two shouldn't occur independently (i.e. one shouldn't fail while the other succeeds).

One solution to this problem is the [Transactional Outbox Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html).

**Idempotent subscribers**

Events can be delivered more than once, but they should only be _processed_ once. To do this your subscribers need to identify and disregard duplicate events.

Usually checking for duplicate payloads or IDs is enough. When you receive an event you've seen before don't process it, skip straight to returning a `success` response from your subscriber.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { topic } from '@nitric/sdk'
import { isDuplicate } from '../common'

const updates = topic('updates')

updates.subscribe((ctx) => {
  if (isDuplicate(ctx.req)) {
    return ctx
  }
  // not a duplicate, process the event
  // ...
})
```

```python
from nitric.resources import topic
from common import is_duplicate

updates = topic("updates")

@updates.subscribe()
async def process_update(ctx):
	if is_duplicate(ctx.req):
		return ctx

	# not a duplicate, process the event
	# ...
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  If you're checking for duplicate IDs, make sure publishers can't resend failed
  events with new IDs.
</Note>

## Queues

Queues and Tasks provide a scalable, decoupled, way for functions and containers to communicate asynchronously.

### Queues

Queues are named targets where tasks can be sent. They can be thought of as a group of related tasks. Unlike [topics](#topics), tasks sent to a queue won't automatically trigger functions to process them. Instead, functions receive tasks from the queue by requesting them.

This makes queues awesome for processing work asynchronously, often paired with [schedules](/schedules) to support batch workloads, like nightly processes.

### Tasks

A task is a form of message that can be sent to a queue. They can be thought of as a collection of data that has been queued for processing some time in the future. Tasks have the following properties:

<Properties>
  <Property name="id" type="string">
    Unique id to apply to the task. If an id isn't provided, a version 4 UUID
    will be auto-generated instead.
  </Property>
  <Property name="payload" required type="Map<string, any>">
    Payload to be sent with the task.
  </Property>
  <Property name="payloadType" type="string">
    The type of payload supplied.
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Creating a Queue

Nitric allows you to define named queues. When defining queues, you can give the function permissions for receiving and sending.

Here's an example of how to create a queue with permissions for sending and receiving.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { queue } from '@nitric/sdk'

const transactionQueue = queue('transactions').for('sending', 'receiving')
```

```python
from nitric.resources import queue

transaction_queue = queue("transactions").allow("sending", "receiving")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Sending Tasks

To send a task to a queue, use the `send()` method on the queue reference. The function must have permissions to `send` to the queue.

The below example sends a message to a queue called `transactions`.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { queue } from '@nitric/sdk'

const transactionQueue = queue('transactions').for('sending')

await transactionQueue.send({
  payload: {
    message: 'hello world',
  },
})
```

```python
from nitric.resources import queue

transaction_queue = queue("transactions").allow("sending")

# Both will send the same event
await transaction_queue.send({
	"message": "hello world"
})

await transaction_queue.send({
	"payload": {
		"message": "hello world"
	}
})
```

</CodeGroup>

Tasks can also be sent in batches by providing an array of tasks.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { queue } from '@nitric/sdk'

const transactionQueue = queue('transactions').for('sending')

await transactionQueue.send([
  {
    payload: {
      message: 'batch task 1',
    },
  },
  {
    payload: {
      message: 'batch task 2',
    },
  },
])
```

```python
from nitric.resources import queue

transaction_queue = queue("transactions").allow("sending")

# Both will send the same events
await transaction_queue.send([{
	{
		"message": "batch task 1"
	}, {
		"message": "batch task 2"
	}
}])

await transaction_queue.send([
	{
		"payload": {
			"message": "hello world"
		}
	}, {
		"payload": {
			"message": "hello world"
		}
	}
])
```

</CodeGroup>

### Receiving and Acknowledging Tasks

When you pull tasks from a queue, they are not immediately deleted. Instead, they are leased, which means they are temporarily hidden from other functions until the lease expires.

To ensure proper handling, your code should mark a task as `complete` after successfully processing it. This action permanently removes the task from the queue.

If a lease expires before a task is marked as complete, the task will reappear in the queue and can be received again. This mechanism prevents tasks from getting lost in case of failures. If your function encounters an error or is terminated before completing a task, it will automatically reappear in the queue, ready to be processed again.

By following this approach, you can ensure reliable task processing and minimize the chances of losing tasks in failure scenarios.

The below example receives 10 tasks using the `receive()` method, and then acknowledges the task as completed using the `complete()` method. You'll note that the function has permissions to receive messages.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { queue } from '@nitric/sdk'

const transactionQueue = queue('transactions').for('receiving')

const tasks = await transactionQueue.receive(10)

for (let task of tasks) {
  // process your task's data
  console.log(task.payload)

  // acknowledge when the task is complete
  await task.complete()
}
```

```python
from nitric.resources import queue

transaction_queue = queue("transactions").allow("receiving")

tasks = await transaction_queue.receive(10)

for task in tasks:
	# process your task's data
	print(task.payload)

	# acknowledge when the task is complete
	await task.complete()
```

</CodeGroup>

## Choosing between queues and topics

It's common to ask when to use a queue or a topic. From a publisher's point of view, both queues and topics are almost identical. The difference is primarily on the receiver/subscriber side. Topics push new messages to their subscribers, immediately spinning up workers to process the events, while queues rely on the receiver to ask for new messages to process.

For these reasons, we usually default to Topics. Queues are more suitable for batch workloads or situations where there are occasional surges of requests that can be processed at a later time.
