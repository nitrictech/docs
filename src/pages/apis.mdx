export const description = 'Building HTTP APIs with Nitric'

# APIs

Nitric has built-in support for web apps and HTTP API development. The `api` resource allows you to create APIs in your applications, including routing, middleware and request handlers.

## Creating APIs

Nitric allows you define named APIs, each with their own routes, middleware, handlers and security.

Here's an example of how to create a new API with Nitric:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { api } from '@nitric/sdk'

// each API needs a unique name
const galaxyApi = api('far-away-galaxy-api')

galaxyApi.get('/moon', async ({ req, res }) => {
  res.body = "that's no moon, it's a space station."
})
```

```python
from nitric.resources import api
from nitric.application import Nitric

# each API needs a unique name
galaxy_api = api('far-away-galaxy-api')

@galaxy_api.get("/moon")
async def get_moon(ctx):
  ctx.res.body = "that's no moon, it's a space station."

Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>

## Routing

You can define routes and handler services for incoming requests using methods on your API objects.

For example, you can declare a route that handles `POST` requests using the `post()` method. When declaring routes you provide the path to match and a callback that will serve as the handler for matching requests.

<Note>
  Depending on the language SDK, callbacks are either passed as parameters or
  defined using decorators.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { getPlanetList, createPlanet } from 'planets'

galaxyApi.get('/planets', async (ctx) => {
  ctx.res.json(getPlanetList())
})

galaxyApi.post('/planets', async (ctx) => {
  createPlanet(ctx.req.json())
  ctx.res.status = 201
})
```

```python
from planets import get_planets_list, create_planet

@galaxy_api.get("/planets")
async def list_planets(ctx):
  ctx.res.body = get_planets_list()

@galaxy_api.post("/planets")
async def create_planet(ctx):
  create_planet(ctx.req.json())
  ctx.res.status = 201
```

</CodeGroup>

### Request Context

Nitric provides callbacks with a single context object that gives you everything you need to read requests and write responses. By convention this object is typically named `ctx`.

The context object includes a request `req` and response `res`, which in turn provide convenient methods for reading and writing bodies, as well as auto-extracted parameters and HTTP headers.

#### Parameters

The path string used to declare routes can include named parameters. The values collected from those parameters are automatically included in the context object under `ctx.req.params`.

<Note>Path parameters are denoted by a colon prefix `:`</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { getPlanet } from 'planets'

// create a dynamic route and extract the parameter `name`
galaxyApi.get('/planets/:name', async (ctx) => {
  const { name } = ctx.req.params
  ctx.res.json(getPlanet(name))
})
```

```python
from planets import get_planet

# create a dynamic route and extract the parameter `name`
@galaxy_api.get("/planets/:name")
async def get_planet_route(ctx):
  name = ctx.req.params['name']
  ctx.res.body = get_planet(name)
```

</CodeGroup>

#### HTTP status and headers

The response object provides `status` and `headers` properties you can use to return HTTP status codes and headers.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
// return a redirect response using status 301
galaxyApi.get('/planets/alderaan', async (ctx) => {
  ctx.res.status = 301
  ctx.res.headers['Location'] = ['https://example.org/debris/alderaan']
})
```

```python
# return a redirect response using status 301
@galaxy_api.get("/planets/alderaan")
async def find_alderaan(ctx):
  ctx.res.status = 301
  ctx.res.headers["Location"] = "https://example.org/debris/alderaan"
```

</CodeGroup>

## API Security

APIs can include security definitions for OIDC-compatible providers such as [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [FusionAuth](https://fusionauth.io/) and [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/).

<Note>
  Applying security at the API allows AWS, Google Cloud and Azure to reject
  unauthenticated or unauthorized requests at the API Gateway, before invoking
  your application code. In serverless environments this reduces costs by
  limiting application load from unwanted or malicious requests.
</Note>

### Authentication

APIs can be configured to automatically authenticate and allow or reject incoming requests. A `securityDefinitions` object can be provided, which _defines_ the authentication requirements that can later be enforced by the API.

The security definition describes the kind of authentication to perform and the configuration required to perform it. For a [JWT](https://jwt.io/) this configuration includes the JWT issuer and audiences.

<Note>
  Security definitions only define **available** security requirements for an
  API, they don't automatically **apply** those requirements.
</Note>

Once a security definition is available it can be applied to the entire API or selectively to individual routes.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { api } from '@nitric/sdk'

const secureApi = api('main', {
  // declare security definition named 'default'.
  securityDefinitions: {
    default: {
      kind: 'jwt',
      issuer: 'https://dev-abc123.us.auth0.com',
      audiences: ['https://test-security-definition/'],
    },
  },
  // apply the 'default' security definition to all routes in this API.
  security: {
    default: [],
  },
})
```

```python
from nitric.resources import api, ApiOptions, JwtSecurityDefinition
from nitric.application import Nitric

secureApi = api("main", opts=ApiOptions(
        # declare security definition named 'default'.
        security_definitions={
            "default": JwtSecurityDefinition(
                issuer="https://dev-abc123.us.auth0.com",
                audiences=["https://test-security-definition/"],
            )
        }
        # apply the 'default' security definition to all routes in this API.
        security={
            "default": [],
        },
    )
)

Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>

### Authorization

In addition to authentication, Nitric APIs can also be configured to perform authorization based on scopes. Again, this can be done at the top level of the API or on individual routes.

Add the required scopes to the `security` object when applying a security definition.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
const helloApi = api('main', {
  security: {
    // only authorize requests with the 'user.read' scope
    user: ['user.read'],
  },
  securityDefinitions: {
    user: {
      kind: 'jwt',
      issuer: 'https://dev-abc123.us.auth0.com',
      audiences: ['https://test-security-definition/'],
    },
  },
})
```

```python
from nitric.resources import api, ApiOptions, JwtSecurityDefinition
from nitric.application import Nitric

helloApi = api("main", opts=ApiOptions(
        security={
            # only authorize requests with the 'user.read' scope
            "user": ["user.read"],
        },
        security_definitions={
            "user": JwtSecurityDefinition(
                issuer="https://dev-abc123.us.auth0.com",
                audiences=["https://test-security-definition/"],
            )
        }
    )
)

Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>

For an in-depth tutorial look at the [Auth0 integration guide](/guides/getting-started/nodejs/secure-api-auth0)

### Override API-level security

Individual routes can have their own security rules which apply any available `securityDefinition`. The requirement defined on routes override any requirements previously set at the top level of the API.

This allows you to selectively increase or decrease the security requirements for specific routes.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
galaxyApi.get('planets/unsecured-planet', async (ctx) => {}, {
  // override top level security to remove security from this route
  security: {},
})

galaxyApi.post('planets/secured-planet', async (ctx) => {}, {
  // override top level security to require user.write scope to access
  security: {
    user: ['user.write'],
  },
})
```

```python
# override top level security to remove security from this route
@galaxy_api.get("planets/unsecured-planet", opts=MethodOptions(security=dict()))
async def get_planet(ctx):
    pass

# override top level security to require user.write scope to access
@galaxy_api.post("planets/secured-planet", opts=MethodOptions(security={ "user": ['user.write'] }))
async def get_planet(ctx):
    pass
```

</CodeGroup>

## Defining Middleware

Behavior that's common to several APIs or routes can be applied using middleware services. Multiple middleware can also be composed to create a cascading set of steps to perform on incoming requests or outgoing responses.

Middleware services look nearly identical to handlers except for an additional parameter called `next`, which is the next middleware or handler to be called in the chain. By providing each middleware the next middleware in the chain it allows them to intercept requests, response and errors to perform operations like logging, decoration, exception handling and many other common tasks.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
async function validate(ctx, next) {
  if (!ctx.req.headers['content-type']) {
    ctx.res.status = 400
    ctx.res.body = 'header Content-Type is required'
    return ctx
  }
  return await next(ctx)
}
```

```python
async def validate(ctx, nxt: HttpMiddleware):
  if ctx.req.headers['content-type'] is None:
    ctx.res.status = 400;
    ctx.res.body = "header Content-Type is required"
    return ctx
  return await nxt(ctx)
```

</CodeGroup>

### API level middleware

Middleware defined at the API level will be called on every request to every route.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { api } from '@nitric/sdk'
import { validate, logRequest } from '../middleware'

const customersApi = api('customers', {
  middleware: [logRequest, validate],
})
```

```python
from nitric.resources import api, ApiOptions
from common.middleware import validate, log_request
from nitric.application import Nitric

customers_api = api("customers", opts=ApiOptions(middleware=[log_request, validate]))

Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>

### Route level middleware

Middleware defined at the route level will only be called for that route.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { api } from '@nitric/sdk'
import { validate } from '../middleware'

const customersApi = api('customers')

const getAllCustomers = (ctx) => {}

// Inline using .get()
customersApi.get('/customers', [validate, getAllCustomers])

// Using .route()
customersApi.route('/customers').get([validate, getAllCustomers])
```

```txt {{ language: 'python' }}
Route level middleware currently not supported in python
```

</CodeGroup>

## Custom Domains

<Note>Custom domains are currently only supported for AWS deployments.</Note>

By default APIs deployed by Nitric will be assigned a domain by the target cloud provider. If you would like to deploy APIs with predefined custom domains you can specify the custom domains for each API in your project's stack files. For these domains to be successfully configured you will need to meet the prerequisites defined for each cloud provider below.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml {{ title: "AWS", tag: "nitric-prod.yaml (stack file)" }}
name: my-aws-stack
provider: nitric/aws@1.0.0
region: ap-southeast-2

# Add a key for configuring apis
apis:
  # Target an API by its nitric name
  my-api-name:
    # provide domains to be used for the api
    domains:
      - test.example.com
```

```yaml {{ title: "Azure", tag: "nitric-prod.yaml (stack file)" }}
# currently unsupported - request support here: https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/issues
```

```yaml {{ title: "Google Cloud", tag: "nitric-prod.yaml (stack file)" }}
# currently unsupported - request support here: https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/issues
```

</CodeGroup>

### AWS Custom Domain Prerequisites

To support custom domains with APIs deployed to AWS your domain (or subdomain) will need to be setup as a [hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-working-with.html) in Route 53.

The general steps to setup a hosted zone in Route 53 are as follows:

- Navigate to Route 53 in the AWS Console
- Select 'hosted zones' from the left navigation
- Click 'Create hosted zone'
- Enter your domain name and choose the 'Public hosted zone' type.
- Click 'Create hosted zone'
- You will now be provided with a set of NS DNS records to configure in the DNS provider for your domain
- Create the required DNS records, then wait for the DNS changes to propagate

Once this is done you will be able to use the hosted zone domain or any direct subdomain with your Nitric APIs.

You can read more about how AWS suggests configuring hosted zones in their documentation on [Making Route 53 the DNS service for a domain that's in use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/migrate-dns-domain-in-use.html) or [Making Route 53 the DNS service for an inactive domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/migrate-dns-domain-inactive.html)

<Note>
  If the hosted zone was `nitric.io`, `nitric.io` or `api.nitric.io` would be
  supported for APIs, but not `public.api.nitric.io` since that is a subdomain
  of a subdomain.
</Note>

<Note>
  DNS propagation of the NS records can take a few seconds to a few hours due to
  the nature of DNS.
</Note>

## Serving from multiple files

Nitric APIs are scoped to the project and can be referenced from multiple `services`. This allows you to choose the granularity of services that suites your project. For small projects you might have a single service that serves all routes, while in larger projects multiple services might combine to serve paths and methods for your API.

### Using the same resource name

Since resource names are unique across each Nitric project, you can access a resource in multiple locations by simply reusing it's name. Here's an example of services in different files serving different paths on the same API.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript {{ tag: 'services/one.js' }}
import { api } from '@nitric/sdk'

const accountsApi = api('accounts')

accountsApi.get('/users/:id', async () => {
  // your logic here
})
```

```python {{ tag: 'services/one.py' }}
from nitric.application import Nitric
from nitric.context import HttpContext
from nitric.resources import api

accounts_api = api('accounts')

@accounts_api.get("/users/:id")
async def get_user(ctx: HttpContext):
    pass # your logic here

Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript {{ tag: 'services/two.js' }}
import { api } from '@nitric/sdk'

const accountsApi = api('accounts')

accountsApi.get('/orgs/:id', async () => {
  // your logic here
})
```

```python {{ tag: 'services/two.py' }}
from nitric.application import Nitric
from nitric.context import HttpContext
from nitric.resources import api

accounts_api = api('accounts')

@accounts_api.get("/orgs/:id")
async def get_org(ctx: HttpContext):
    pass # your logic here

Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Calling `api()` multiple times with the same name returns the same API
  resource each time, allowing it to be referenced in multiple services.
</Note>

### Importing an existing resource

While reusing a name is useful, it can lead to errors due to typos or when the configuration of the resource is complex. For this reason it's often preferable to declare the resource in a shared location and import it into the services as needed.

Here is the same example enhanced to import a common API resource.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript {{ tag: 'resources/index.js' }}
import { api } from '@nitric/sdk'

export const accountsApi = api('accounts')
```

```python {{ tag: 'common/resources.py' }}
from nitric.resources import api

accounts_api = api('accounts')
```

</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript {{ tag: 'services/one.js' }}
import { accountsApi } from '../resources'

accountsApi.get('/users/:id', async () => {
  // your logic here
})
```

```python {{ tag: 'services/one.py' }}
from nitric.application import Nitric
from nitric.context import HttpContext
from common.resources import accounts_api


@accounts_api.get("/users/:id")
async def get_user(ctx: HttpContext):
    pass # your logic here

Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript {{ tag: 'services/two.js' }}
import { accountsApi } from '../resources'

accountsApi.get('/orgs/:id', async () => {
  // your logic here
})
```

```python {{ tag: 'services/two.py' }}
from nitric.application import Nitric
from nitric.context import HttpContext
from common.resources import accounts_api


@accounts_api.get("/orgs/:id")
async def get_org(ctx: HttpContext):
    pass # your logic here

Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>
