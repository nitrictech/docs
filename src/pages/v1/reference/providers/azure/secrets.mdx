export const description = 'How Nitric deploys Secrets to Azure'

# Azure Resources - Secrets

Nitric Secrets are deployed to Azure using [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/).

## Azure Resources

- An Azure Key Vault instance per app

<Note>
  Unlike AWS Secrets Manager and GCP Secret Manager, which are both secrets
  services. Azure Key Vault requires 'Vault' resources to be created before
  secrets can be stored. For this reason, Nitric will create a Vault for each of
  your applications during deployment if it doesn't already exist.
</Note>

## Deployment

During deployment the Nitric CLI builds your Secrets will be built as follows:

- If secrets are referenced anywhere in your application a Key Vault instance will be deployed
- Container Apps are configured to permit access the Key Vault instance
