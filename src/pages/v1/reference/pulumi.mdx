export const description = 'How nitric integrates with Pulumi'

# Pulumi

Nitric's cloud deployments are built on a pluggable interface known as [providers](/reference/providers). All of Nitric's core providers [AWS](/reference/providers/aws), [GCP](/reference/providers/gcp) and [Azure](/reference/providers/azure) are powered by [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com). When using these providers you can [integrate Nitric into your existing Pulumi setup](./pulumi/pulumi-cloud), as easily as you could with your own Pulumi programs.

You can also extend these providers using the [Pulumi Automation API](https://www.pulumi.com/automation/) to [write your own Nitric providers](./pulumi/custom-providers).
