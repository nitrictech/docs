export const description = 'Integrating with existing HTTP frameworks'

# HTTP

Nitric supports existing web app and API frameworks. The `http` resource allows you to connect Nitric to your existing applications.

## Enabling in your project

HTTP framework support is currently in preview, to enable it in your Nitric project add the following to your `nitric.yaml` file

```yaml
preview-features:
  - http
```

## Connecting existing frameworks

Here are some examples of how to connect your existing API frameworks with Nitric:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript {{ title: "Node.js (express.js)" }}
import { http } from '@nitric/sdk'
import express from "express"

const app = express()

app.use("/hello", (req, res) => {
  res.send("hello from express")
});

http(app)
```

```javascript {{ title: "Node.js (nestjs)", tag: "app.module.ts" }}
import { http } from '@nitric/sdk'
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core'
import { AppModule } from './app.module'

async function bootstrap(port: number) {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule)
  await app.listen(port)
}

http(bootstrap)
```

```python
# Not yet supported if you would like support let us know at: https://github.com/nitrictech/python-sdk/issues
