  "Reference for Nitric's Node.js library - Creates a new Queue to send and receive asynchronous tasks."

# Node.js - queue()

Creates a new Queue to send and receive asynchronous tasks.

```javascript
import { queue } from '@nitric/sdk'

const batchQueue = queue('batch').for('sending')
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  <Property name="name" required type="string">
    The unique name of this Queue within the service. Subsequent calls to
    `queue` with the same name will return the same object.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Access

All Nitric resources provide access permissions you can use to specify the level of access your service needs to the resource. See here for details [Access Control documentation](/assets/access-control).

### Available permissions:

---

**sending**

This permission allows your service to send new tasks to the queue.

---

**receiving**

This permission allows your service to receive tasks from the queue.

---

### Notes

In most instances, code should either send to or receive from a queue, usually not both.

## Examples

### Create a Queue

```javascript
import { queue } from '@nitric/sdk'

const batchQueue = queue('batch')
```

### Receive tasks from a queue

```javascript
import { queue } from '@nitric/sdk'

const payload = {}
const batchQueue = queue('batch').for('receiving')

const tasks = await batchQueue.receive()
```
