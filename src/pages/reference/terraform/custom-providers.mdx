# Building Nitric providers using Terraform

If you're not already familiar with the basics of Nitric providers, a detailed overview on how Nitric providers work under the hood can be found [here](../providers/custom/building-custom-provider).

Nitric's providers are simple programs that implement a plugin interface backed by gRPC. A Nitric provider is a simple server that will be started by the Nitric CLI at deploy time and will be provided with a cloud specification to deploy any way the provider sees fit.
