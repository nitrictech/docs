# Nitric CLI

The Nitric CLI allows you to build, develop, and deploy your serverless application.

To verify your [installation](/guides/getting-started/installation) run `nitric version`. If a version is printed, the CLI is installed correctly.

To get a list of the available commands, run the following command:

```
nitric help

Usage:
  nitric [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  down        Undeploy a previously deployed stack, deleting resources
  feedback    Provide feedback on your experience with nitric
  help        Help about any command
  info        Gather information about Nitric and the environment
  list        List all project stacks and their status
  new         Create a new project
  run         Run your project locally for development and testing
  stack       Manage stacks (the deployed app containing multiple resources e.g. services, buckets and topics)
  up          Create or update a deployed stack
  version     Print the version number of this CLI

Flags:
  -h, --help                   help for nitric
  -o, --output stringEnumVar   output format (default table)
  -v, --verbose int            set the verbosity of output (larger is more verbose) (default 1)

Use "nitric [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Common Commands

There are a few common commands that you will use frequently:

- `nitric new` creates a new project
- `nitric stack new` creates a new stack within a project
- `nitric start` runs the Nitric server locally
- `nitric up` deploys your stack to the cloud
- `nitric down` destroys your stack from the cloud

## Getting Started

### Projects

To start a new project with nitric, run the `nitric new` command.

```
nitric new
```

This will walk through creating the project, including the name and what template you want to start from.

The command will also create a `nitric.yaml` file. This file contains the configuration for your project. The services key is list of globs for your services. The services should point to all services you want to run or deploy.

```yaml
name: my-project
services:
  - match: services/*.ts
    start: ts-node $SERVICE_PATH
```

If you want to specify a specific type of service that matches your stack config, you can use this syntax instead:

```yaml
name: my-project
services:
  - match: services/*.ts
    start: ts-node $SERVICE_PATH
    type: default
  - match: custom/*.ts
    start: ts-node $SERVICE_PATH
    type: memory-optimized
```

### Stacks

Creating a new stack will create a configuration for a particular cloud. You can have multiple stacks for one project.

```
nitric stack new
```

This will create a `nitric.stackName.yaml` file that contains the configuration for deploying to the cloud. Some providers will have different config, here's an example of an aws stack:

```yaml
# nitric.my-aws-stack.yaml
provider: nitric/aws@1.0.0
region: us-east-1
```

<Note>The cloud configuration is separate to the cloud credentials.</Note>

<Note>
  You will still have to set your cloud credentials on your first deployment by
  following the guide in the cloud's section in the reference documentation.
</Note>

If you want to specify different configuration for your services you can use the following syntax:

```yaml
# nitric.my-aws-stack.yaml
provider: nitric/aws@1.0.0
region: us-east-1
telemetry: 10
config:
  default:
    lambda:
      memory: 1024
  memory-optimized:
    lambda:
      memory: 4096
```

## Development

When you are done developing your application and you want to run and test it locally, you can use the `nitric start` command.

```
nitric start
```

This will run the Nitric server for local testing. This will output a local endpoint so that you can test your apis.

## Deployment

### Deploying the Stack

Once you have tested your application locally and you're ready to deploy, you can do `nitric up`. This command can be optionally supplied with the name of a stack with the `-s` or `--stack` argument. However, the stack will be auto-detected if there is only one or options will be presented if there are multiple. This will set the cloud configuration for that particular deployment.

If this is your first deployment, you will have to set up your cloud credentials before deploying to the cloud. You can find the guides for these in the cloud's section in the reference documentation. The AWS guide is [here](/reference/providers/aws).

```bash
nitric up
```

<Note>
  Each of the cloud provider's deployments take different amounts of time.
</Note>

### Destroying the Deployment

If you make changes and want to redeploy, you don't have to take the application down, you can just redeploy and it will find the difference. However, if you do want to destroy the application completely, you can use the `nitric down` command.

```
nitric down
```

<Note>This will prompt you again before destroying the stack.</Note>

### Listing Stacks

To get information about your stacks, use the `nitric list` command.

This will provide give information about its name, its deployment status, when it was last updated, the resource count, and a url to view the deployment on the pulumi console (will require a pulumi account).

## Info

To get information about the CLI version you are using, you can use:

```
nitric version
```

To get more detailed information about the Nitric runtime, you can use:

```
nitric info
```

For information regarding individual commands, use the `--help` argument on any of the CLI commands. Alternatively you can run:

```
nitric help
```

For more verbose input, specify a verbosity level with `--verbose`. The larger the number, the more verbose.

## Feedback

If you want to provide feedback on the CLI or the framework in general, you can use the `nitric feedback` command. This will template a github issue for you to submit. Alternatively, you can open an issue manually [here](https://github.com/nitrictech/cli/issues/new/choose).

```
nitric feedback
```
