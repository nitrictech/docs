# Stacks

## Stacks

A Nitric stack represents a pairing of a project and its deployment target. A project may have multiple stacks as the deployment target is broken down into a cloud provider e.g. `aws` and a region e.g. `us-east-1`.

If your project needs to deploy to `aws` in two regions `us-east-1` and `eu-west-1`, you'll have two stack definitions in your project.

## Creating a stack

To create a stack use the new command from your project root. Each stack name must be unique within the project.

```bash
nitric stack new
```

Follow the prompts to create a stack for your provider.

```
? What do you want to call your new stack? aws-stack
? Which Cloud do you wish to deploy to? aws
? select the region us-east-1
```

The stack definition will be created in the root of your project as a YAML file prefixed with `nitric-` e.g. `nitric-aws-stack.yaml`

```yaml
name: my-aws-stack
provider: nitric/aws@0.24.0
region: us-east-1
```

If you want to specify different configuration for your functions you can use the following syntax:

```yaml
name: my-aws-stack
provider: nitric/aws@0.24.0
region: us-east-1
config:
  default:
    lambda:
      memory: 1024
      telemetry: 10
    target: lambda
  memory-optimized:
    lambda:
      memory: 4096
```

<Note>
  For more information on what can be configured, [look

</Note>

Once you have created a stack, you're ready to deploy and undeploy to your deployment target. See the [CLI docs](/reference/cli) for available commands.

### Legacy Stacks

Previously stacks were not tied to a specific runtime and did not version the providers. It had the following format:

```yaml
name: my-aws-stack
provider: aws
region: us-east-1
config:
  default:
    memory: 1024
    telemetry: 10
  memory-optimized:
    memory: 4096
```

The provider has been updated from `aws`, `gcp`, and `azure` to `nitric/aws@0.24.0`, `nitric/gcp@0.24.0`, and `nitric/azure@0.24.0` respectively. This change enables locking a version for your deployments, as it was previously tied to the CLI version. This change will also enable creation of your own [custom deployment providers](/reference/providers/custom/building-custom-provider).

There was also a change to the way configuration is written to support multiple execution runtimes. Currently there are no new runtimes supported (just Lambda, Cloud Run, and Container Apps), however there are plans to support more in the near future, hence the change. The migration involves adding the runtime key to the configuration, letting the deployment know what runtime it should apply the configuration to.

```yaml
# Legacy
config:
  default:
    memory: 1024
  memory-optimized:
    memory: 4096

# New AWS Config
config:
  default:
    lambda:
      memory: 1024 # in MB
    target: lambda
  memory-optimized:
    # A non-default configuration does not need to specify a target
    # It picks up from which runtime config is provided
    lambda:
      memory: 4096

# New GCP Config
config:
  default:
    cloudrun:
      memory: 1024 # in MB
    target: cloudrun
  memory-optimized:
    cloudrun:
      memory: 4096

# New Azure Config
config:
  default:
    containerapps:
      memory: 1 # in GB
    target: containerapps
  memory-optimized:
    containerapps:
      memory: 4
```

## Updating a stack definition

You are free to manually edit the stack definition if required, ensure that both the provider and region values are valid or simply run the `nitric stack new` command again.
