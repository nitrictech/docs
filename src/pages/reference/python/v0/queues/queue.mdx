  "Reference for Nitric's Python library - Creates a new Queue to send and receive asynchronous tasks."

# Python - queue()

Creates a new Queue to send and receive asynchronous tasks.

```python
from nitric.resources import queue

batch_queue = queue('batch').allow('sending')
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  <Property name="name" required type="string">
    The unique name of this Queue within the app. Subsequent calls to `queue`
    with the same name will return the same object.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Access

All Nitric resources provide access permissions you can use to specify the level of access your code needs to the resource. See here for details [Access Control documentation](../../../../access-control).

### Available permissions:

---

**sending**

This permission allows your code to send new tasks to the queue.

---

**receiving**

This permission allows your code to receive tasks from the queue.

---

### Notes

In most instances code should either send to or receive from a queue, usually not both.

## Examples

### Create a Queue

```python
from nitric.resources import queue

batch_queue = queue('batch').allow('sending')
```

### Send tasks to a queue

```python
from nitric.resources import queue
from nitric.api import Task

batch_queue = queue('batch').allow('sending')

payload = {}
await batch_queue.send(Task(payload=payload))
```

### Receive tasks from a queue

```python
from nitric.resources import queue

payload = {}
batch_queue = queue('batch').for('receiving')

tasks = await batch_queue.receive(10)
```
