# AWS Provider Overview

The officially supported Nitric AWS Provider.

## Variants

The Nitric AWS provider is available in two variants, while these variants are functionally similar, deploying the same underlying cloud resources, they are implemented using different Infrastructure-as-Code tools:

- [Pulumi (Standard)](/reference/providers/aws)
- [Terraform](/reference/providers/terraform/aws)

The Pulumi provider is recommended for most users, as it provides the most streamlined experience with Nitric. The Terraform provider is recommended for users already familiar with Terraform, particularly if you have existing Terraform tools or workflows you'd like to integrate with Nitric.

## Usage

The AWS provider is supported by the Nitric SDKs and CLI by default. However, credentials for an AWS account will be required when using the [up command](/reference/cli) from the CLI.

### AWS Credentials

The Nitric CLI uses standard AWS credential settings to authenticate with AWS. If you've set credentials for the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK previously, these settings should work without modification.

If you're setting your credentials for the first time, there are several available methods. We recommend the standard AWS credentials file to get started.

#### AWS Credential File Setup

Create a new credentials files at one of these locations:

- `~/.aws/credentials` on Linux, macOS, or Unix
- `C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials` on Windows

The file should contain the following:

```toml
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your_access_key_id
aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_access_key
```

<Note>
  To use a different AWS profile for your deployments, you can use the
  `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable. If no profile is supplied, we will use the
  `[default]` profile.
</Note>

Replace `your_access_key_id` and `your_secret_access_key` with your own values.

You can create an Access Key by logging into the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and navigating to:
`Username Menu > Security credentials > Access keys > Create New Access Key`

<Note>
  See [AWS
  documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html)
  for full details on credentials and configuration.
