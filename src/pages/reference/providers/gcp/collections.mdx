# Google Cloud Resources - Collections

Nitric Collections are deployed to Google Cloud using [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore).

## Google Cloud Resources

No resources are provisioned at deploy time, collections will be created as needed at runtime.

## Deployment

During deployment, nitric may deploy an App Engine application to your project if one does not already exist, this ensures the App Engine region of your Google Cloud project is set.

<Note>Note: This is required for firestore to operate.</Note>
