# Azure Provider Overview

The officially supported Nitric Azure Provider.

## Status: _Preview_

The Azure provider is implemented and working, except for [Schedules](/schedules). However, it is in public preview and subject to change. Where possible upgrades will be automated.

<Note>
  Nitric runs Functions (APIs, Schedules and Topic Subscribers) on Azure
  Container Apps, which is currently in preview in the US East 2 region only.
</Note>

## Usage

The Azure provider is supported by the Nitric SDKs and CLI by default. However, credentials for an Azure account will be required when using the [deploy command](/reference/cli) from the CLI.

## Azure CLI Installation

Installing the Azure CLI assists with credentials setup. You can install it using these summarized instructions, for more options see the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Windows

Download & install the [latest CLI release](https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows).

### Linux

```
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```

### Install with Homebrew on macOS

```bash
brew update && brew install azure-cli
```

## Azure Credentials

The Nitric CLI uses the standard Azure credentials to authenticate with Azure. If you've set up local credentials for the Azure CLI or an SDK previously, these settings should work without modification.

If you're setting up your credentials for the first time, simply run azure login command and finish the login via your browser.

```bash
  az login
```

Verify the Azure CLI install -

```bash
  az -v
```

<Note>
  See [Azure
  documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli)
  for full details on credentials and configuration.
