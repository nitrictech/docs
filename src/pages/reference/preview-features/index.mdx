# Preview Features

Nitric releases some features as previews to gather feedback and ensure they meet the needs of users. These features are typically enabled through a preview feature flag. Preview features may not be suitable for production use, but they are available for testing and feedback.

After a preview feature has been tested and refined, it may be released as a stable feature in a future version of Nitric. However, preview features may also be removed or changed significantly based on feedback.

Each preview feature will have its own documentation page, which will include information on how to enable the feature and how to use it.
