# Providers

Nitric can declare and interact with cloud features in a way that doesn't couple with the cloud. Nitric providers are the abstraction layer that enables this.

Providers are individual plugins comprised of two components, the logic which deploys your services and the logic to handle SDK calls at runtime.

## How it works

The code you write declares a number of resources, services, and permissions. The following code defines an API named `main` and a bucket named `images`, with permissions to `read` and `write`.

```js
import { api, bucket } from '@nitric/sdk'

const images = bucket('images').allow('read', 'write')
const mainApi = api('main')
```

The Nitric CLI would take these code declarations and send it to the provider for deployment. The provider will then convert this declaration to actual cloud infrastructure. The specific cloud service that the provider will use for each Nitric resource is listed in the table below.

```js
mainApi.get('/', async (ctx) => {
  const imageContents = await images.file('cat.png').read()

  ctx.res.body = imageContents

  return ctx
})
```

The runtime component will take the abstract calls that you make to the SDK at runtime, like calling `.read()` on a file, and convert that into cloud-specific API calls. This allows your functions to run completely separated from the underlying cloud service.

You can find out more about how the Nitric CLI and SDK interact with providers on our [concepts page](/guides/getting-started/concepts).

## Standard Providers

The providers for AWS, GCP, and Azure are built and maintained by Nitric in our open-source repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/tree/main/cloud). These providers enable deploying and running your code across AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. The following is the underlying cloud services that each of the standard providers use:

| **Resource**                           | **AWS**                                              | **Azure**                                   | **Google Cloud**                             | **Local**                                                                          |

Our code is completely open-source on our [GitHub](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric), so you can know exactly how your resources are being deployed and handled at runtime.

If you have any questions or are curious about building your own custom provider, you can read further documentation [here](./providers/custom/building-custom-provider) or ask our team any questions on [Discord](https://nitric.io/chat).
