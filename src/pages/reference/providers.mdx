# Providers

Nitric can declare and interact with cloud features in a way that is decoupled from any particular cloud provider. Nitric providers are the abstraction layer that enables this.

Providers are separate plugins comprised of two componentsâ€”a Deployment Engine, which automatically deploys your cloud resources and a Runtime Adapter, which handles requests from the SDKs forwarding them to appropriate cloud service APIs.

## How it works

Applications built with nitric declare resources, services, and permissions directly in the application code. The following example defines an API named `main`, a bucket named `images`, and permissions for the service to `read` and `write` from the bucket.

```js {{ tag: 'services/example.js' }}
import { api, bucket } from '@nitric/sdk'

const images = bucket('images').allow('read', 'write')
const mainApi = api('main')
```

The chosen language SDKs forward these resource requests to the Nitric CLI, which compiles a graph of the required resources and their connections. The graph of cloud resources is then sent the chosen provider for deployment. The provider convert this declaration graph into any cloud resources it wishes that fulfill the developers intentions, typically using Infrastructure as Code tools like Pulumi or Terraform.

The specific cloud services that Nitric's out-of-the-box providers use for each resource is listed in the [table below](#standard-providers).

```js
mainApi.get('/', async (ctx) => {
  const imageContents = await images.file('cat.png').read()

  ctx.res.body = imageContents

  return ctx
})
```

The runtime component will take the abstract calls that you make to the SDK at runtime, like calling `.read()` on a file, and convert that into cloud-specific API calls. This allows your functions to run completely separated from the underlying cloud service.

## Standard Providers

The providers for AWS, GCP, and Azure are built and maintained by Nitric in our open-source repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/tree/main/cloud). These providers enable deploying and running your code across AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. The following is the underlying cloud services that each of the standard providers use:

| **Resource**                           | **AWS**                                              | **Azure**                                   | **Google Cloud**                             | **Local**                                                                          |

Our code is completely open-source on our [GitHub](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric), so you can know exactly how your resources are being deployed and handled at runtime.
