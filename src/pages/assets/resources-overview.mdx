# Resources Overview

Nitric provides cloud-native building blocks that make it simple to declare the resources you need as part of your application code.

The Nitric deployment engine will run through your code at deployment time, interpreting resources that are declared as part of your application and creating them in the cloud you are pushing to.

## Rules

There are a few rules to keep in mind when declaring Nitric resources as part of your application.

### Don't declare resources in runtime code

Nitric needs to be aware of resources at deployment time so they can be deployed appropriately. Declaring resources at runtime means the resource won't be declared when deploying your application. Consequently, the resource will not be provisioned to the cloud.

The Nitric deployment engine does not evaluate runtime code at deployment time as this could result in unintended behavior or side effects.

A working example:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { api, bucket } from '@nitric/sdk'

// ✅ This declaration will work
const files = bucket('files').for('reading')

api('public').get('/files/:name', (ctx) => {
  // ❌ This declaration will not work, as this is only called at runtime.
  const badBucket = bucket('wont-work').for('writing')
})
```

```python
from nitric.resources import api, bucket
from nitric.application import Nitric

public_api = api('public')

# ✅ This declaration will work
files = bucket('files').allow('reading')

@public_api.get("/files/:name")
async def get_file(ctx):
  # ❌ This declaration will not work, as this is only called at runtime.
  bad_bucket = bucket('wont-work').allow('writing')

Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>Always declare resources outside of runtime/callback code</Note>

## Best Practices

### ✅ Re-use declarations for shared resources

When many services share a resource it's helpful to re-use resource declaration like any other variable in your code.

For example:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript
// lib/resources.ts
import { api, topic } from '@nitric/sdk'

export const publicApi = api('public')

export const updateTopic = topic('updates')

// services/api.ts
import { publicApi, updateTopic } from '../lib/resources'

const publisher = updateTopic.for('publishing')

publicApi.post('/update', (ctx) => {
  publisher.publish({ test: 'message' })
})

// services/updates.ts
import { updateTopic } from '../lib/resources'

updateTopic.subscribe((ctx) => {
  console.log('got the message')
})
```

```python
# resources.py
from nitric.resources import api, topic

public_api = api('public')
update_topic = topic('updates')


# services/api.py
from resources import public_api, update_topic

publisher = update_topic.allow('publishing')

@public_api.post("/update")
async def new_update(ctx):
  await publisher.publish({"test": "message"})


# services/updates.py
from resources import update_topic

@update_topic.subscribe
async def updates_sub(ctx):
  print(ctx.req.payload)
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Sharing resources like this can avoid nasty typos, and allows easily shared
  references to a single resource using your IDE.
</Note>

### ❌ Avoid declaring permissions for shared resources

Creating resource permissions in the same context as the resources can make those permissions leak. This is demonstrated in the below example:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript
// lib/resources.ts
import { api, bucket } from '@nitric/sdk'

export const publicApi = api('public')

export const bucketOne = bucket('bucket-one').for('reading')
export const bucketTwo = bucket('bucket-two').for('reading')

// services/service-one.ts
import { publicApi, bucketOne } from '../lib/resources'

publicApi.get('bucket-one/file/:name', (ctx) => {
  // do something with the file
})

// services/service-two.ts
import { publicApi, bucketTwo } from '../lib/resources'

publicApi.get('bucket-two/file/:name', (ctx) => {
  // do something with the file
})
```

```python
# resources.py
from nitric.resources import api, bucket
from nitric.application import Nitric

public_api = api('public')

bucket_one = bucket('bucket-one').allow('reading')
bucket_two = bucket('bucket-two').allow('reading')


# services/service-one.py
from resources import public_api, bucket_one
from nitric.application import Nitric

@public_api.get("bucket-one/file/:name")
async def get_file(ctx):
  pass # do something with the file

Nitric.run()


# services/service-two.py
from resources import public_api, bucket_two
from nitric.application import Nitric

@public_api.get("bucket-two/file/:name")
async def get_file(ctx):
  pass # do something with the file

Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>

In this scenario, both `service-one` and `service-two` have read access to **both** buckets, even though each service is only using one of the buckets. This is because they are declared in the same context and evaluated at the same time in each of the services.

Resource permissions should always be declared in the scope of a single service unless the permissions required by one or more services are identical.
