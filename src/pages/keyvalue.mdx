# Key Value Stores

Nitric provides functionality for provisioning and interacting with collections in NoSQL databases.

## Definitions

### Key Value Store

Key value stores act as a database which provides the functionality for efficient reading and writing. The data is fetched via a unique key, which is associated with a value. Due to the uniqueness of the key, accessing the data is incredibly efficient and will occur in constant time as there is no need for complex lookups.

### Key Value Pair

A key value pair refers to the unique key that has a value that it references. The key must be a unique string. The value can be any json serializable object.

## Creating Key Value Stores

Here's an example of how to create a key value store, with permissions for getting, setting, and deleting:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { kv } from '@nitric/sdk'

const countries = kv('Countries').for('getting', 'setting', 'deleting')
```

```typescript
// You can add typing by specifying the type of documents that are stored in the collection.
// This won't do validation of the documents written to the collection.
// However, it will give you type completion when interacting with the collection.
import { kv } from '@nitric/sdk'

type Country = {
  name: string
  population: number
}

const countries = kv<Country>('Countries').for('getting', 'setting', 'deleting')
```

```python
from nitric.resources import kv
from nitric.application import Nitric

countries = kv('Countries').allow('getting', 'setting', 'deleting')

Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>

## Creating Key Value Pairs

Key value pairs are created based on the `key` and the contents of the `value`. If a key already exists in the key value store, then the key and it's value will be overwritten.

> Key value stores that are created using the Nitric SDK are compatible across cloud providers.

The below example first creates a key value store that has permissions for setting. It then adds a key to the store called `USA` and a value which describes the country.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { kv } from '@nitric/sdk'

const countries = kv('Countries').for('setting')

await countries.set('USA', {
  name: 'United States of America',
  population: 329500000,
})
```

```python
from nitric.resources import kv
from nitric.application import Nitric

countries = kv('Countries').allow('setting')

await countries.set('USA', {
  "name": "United States of America",
  "population": 329500000
})

Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>

If you then want to update the value, you will have to write over the existing value by referencing it by it's key.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
await countries.set('USA', {
  name: 'United States of America',
  population: 330000000,
})
```

```python
await countries.set('USA', {
  "name": "United States of America",
  "population": 330000000,
})
```

</CodeGroup>

## Accessing Values

To access a specific value you can use the key that references it.

The below is an example of accessing a value from a key value store.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { kv } from '@nitric/sdk'

const countries = kv('Countries').for('reading')

const country = await country.get('USA')
```

```python
from nitric.resources import kv
from nitric.application import Nitric

countries = kv("Countries").allow("getting")

country = await countries.get("USA")

Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deleting Values

Values can be deleted from the key value store by referencing the key.

The below example first creates a key value store that has permissions for deleting and setting. It then creates a value called `USA`, which is deleted using `delete` on the key.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript
import { kv } from '@nitric/sdk'

const countries = kv('Countries').for('deleting', 'setting')

await countries.set('USA', {
  name: 'United States of America',
  population: 329500000,
})

await countries.delete('USA')
```

```python
from nitric.resources import kv
from nitric.application import Nitric

countries = kv('Countries').allow('writing')

await countries.set('USA', {
  "name": "United States of America",
  "population": 329500000
})

await countries.delete('USA')

Nitric.run()
```

</CodeGroup>
