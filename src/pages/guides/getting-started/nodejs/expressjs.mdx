# Enhance Express.js Apps with Cloud Resources

In this guide we'll be scaffolding a new Express.js application and including the Nitric framework to allow for the addition of other cloud resources like topics, queues and buckets.

<Note>
  This guide relies on the HTTP feature of Nitric which is currently in preview.
  See the docs for this feature to [see how to enable it](/http).
</Note>

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide you'll need the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed locally
- [Nitric CLI](/guides/getting-started/v0/installation) installed
- _(optional)_ Your choice of an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) account

## Getting Started

Let's start by setting up a Nitric project and adding Express.js:

```bash {{ label: 'terminal' }}
nitric new express-example "official/JavaScript - Starter"
```

Then install dependencies and add express:

```
cd express-example
yarn install
yarn add express
```

You can go ahead and open this new project in your editor of choice. You should see a project structure similar to:

```txt
├── functions
│   ├── hello.js
├── node_modules
│   ├── ...
├── .gitignore
├── index.js
├── nitric.yaml
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── yarn.lock
```

In this structure you'll notice the `functions` folder. By default, this is where Nitric expects the entrypoint code for your application. However, that's just a convention, we can change that to anything else that suits our needs.

Let's start by replacing the default `hello.js` function with an `app.js` file ready for the Express.js application:

```bash {{ label: 'terminal' }}
rm ./functions/hello.js

touch ./functions/app.js
```

Now, let's add some express code to get things started.

```javascript {{ label: 'functions/app.js' }}
import express from 'express'
import { http } from '@nitric/sdk'
const app = express()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

http(app)
```

<Note>
  If you're familiar with Express.js you'll notice this example doesn't call
  `app.listen`. The Nitric `http` function takes care of that, as well as
  binding the application to the correct port in each environment.
</Note>

At this point, we're ready to start testing locally. The project comes with a `dev` script by default, let's run that now:

```bash {{ label: 'terminal' }}
yarn dev
```

If everything is working, part of the output will look like this:

```txt
SUCCESS  Started Local Services! (1s)
Local running, use ctrl-C to stop

Proxy | Endpoint
8000  | http://localhost:4001

Dev Dashboard | http://localhost:49152
```

Your express application will now be running with Nitric acting as a proxy, in this case it's available on port `4001`. We can test this in another terminal or web browser.

```bash {{ label: 'terminal' }}
curl localhost:4001
Hello World!
```

## Enhancing Express.js with Nitric

With everything working so far, now is a good time to see how we can add new resources to the Express app using Nitric. In this example, let's add a pub/sub topic which allows us to perform work in the background, but still respond quick via the HTTP API.

You can update the `app.js` file like so:

```javascript {{ label: 'functions/app.js' }}
import express from 'express'
import { http, topic } from '@nitric/sdk'

const app = express()
const workRequests = topic('work-requests').for('publishing')

app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  await workRequests.publish()
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

http(app)
```

We'll also add a new function to do the background work:

```bash
touch functions/worker.js
```

Add this code to that file:

```javascript
import { topic } from '@nitric/sdk'

const sleep = (ms) => new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, ms))

topic('work-requests').subscribe(async (ctx) => {
  console.log('Starting new request')
  // wait for 2 seconds to simulate a long running task
  await sleep(2000)
  console.log('Request processed')
})
```

If it's still running, your application should hot-reload with these changes. Now, when you browse to `localhost:4001` you'll notice that the console outputs these lines with a 2 second delay between each line:

```txt
Starting new request
Request processed
```

<Note>
  You should notice that while the background worker takes 2 seconds to finish,
  the HTTP request `GET: /` still returns instantly.
</Note>

At this point, we can stop the running application and try to deploy it to a cloud provider.

## Deploy to the cloud

This is where the true value of Nitric shines. You don't need to perform any manual cloud deployment activities or add solutions like Terraform to get this project into your cloud environment, Nitric takes care of that for you.

To perform the deployment we'll create a `stack`, stacks give Nitric the config needed for a specific cloud instance of this project, such as the provider and region.

The new stack command can help you create the stack by following prompts. In this case we'll use AWS as an example:

```txt {{ label: 'terminal' }}
nitric stack new
? What should we name this stack? dev
? Which provider do you want to deploy with? aws
? Which region should the stack deploy to? us-east-1
```

This command will create a file named `nitric-dev.yaml`, with contents like this:

```yaml {{ label: 'nitric-dev.yaml' }}
name: dev
provider: nitric/aws@0.30.0
region: us-east-1
```

With the stack file in place we can run the deployment:

```bash {{ label: 'terminal' }}
nitric up
SUCCESS  Images Built (51s)
SUCCESS  Configuration gathered (6s)
SUCCESS
         API | Endpoint
         app | https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Deployed Stack (1m14s)
```

Go ahead and test your new Express+Nitric app in the cloud, you can start with the API Gateway URL returned by the `up` command.

<Note>
  When you're done with the cloud deployment you can tear it down using the
  `nitric down` command.
</Note>
