# Nest.js integration with Nitric

## What we'll be doing

In this guide we will be creating a [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) application and deploying it to the cloud using the Nitric CLI.

The Nest.js application will be able to perform CRUD operations on user profiles that will interact with collections using the Nitric SDK. The project is entirely extensible and is available in our [examples repo](https://github.com/nitrictech/example-apps).

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, here are things you'll need setup ahead of time:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- The [Nitric CLI](/guides/getting-started/installation)
- An [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) account (_your choice_)

## Getting started

To get started we will download the Nest CLI.

```bash
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

We can then use the CLI to scaffold our Nest project.

```bash
nest new nest-x-nitric
```

This will create a src directory with the Nest application code and a test file.

## Adding a Profile controller

Within our src directory we want to replace the base App controller code with a Profile controller.

```typescript
// profile/profile.controller.ts

import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common'
import { ProfileService } from './profile.service'

@Controller()
export class ProfileController {
  constructor(private readonly profileService: ProfileService) {}

  @Get()
  getProfile(): string {
    return this.profileService.getProfile()
  }
}
```

Then update the App service with the Profile service.

```typescript
// profile/profile.service.ts

import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common'

@Injectable()
export class ProfileService {
  getProfile(): string {
    return 'Hello World!'
  }
}
```

We will then need to update the imports for the base App module. We will keep this as the AppModule as its going to act as the entrypoint to our application.

```typescript
// app.module.ts

import { Module } from '@nestjs/common'
import { ProfileController } from './profile/profile.controller'
import { ProfileService } from './profile/profile.service'

@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [ProfileController],
  providers: [ProfileService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Creating the ProfileService

With that done, we can start creating some routes for interacting with our user profiles. We will be storing the profiles in a NoSQL collection which is handled by the Nitric SDK.

```bash
yarn add @nitric/sdk
```

Firstly, we will define our profiles [collection](/collections) and a Profile type at the top of our ProfileService file. The collection will have permissions for reading, writing, and deleting as we will be using all those functions for our Profile service.

```typescript
// profile/profile.service.ts

import { Injectable, NotFoundException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { collection } from '@nitric/sdk';

export interface Profile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const profiles = collection<Profile>('profiles').for(
  'reading',
  'writing',
  'deleting',
);

@Injectable()
export class ProfileService {
  ...
}
```

We can then create some handlers for creating profiles. This will accept a create profile request and return the newly created profile.

```typescript
// profile/profile.service.ts

@Injectable()
export class ProfileService {
  async createProfile(createProfileReq: Omit<Profile, 'id'>): Promise<Profile> {
    const id: string = uuidv4()

    const profile = { id, ...createProfileReq } as Profile

    await profiles.doc(id).set(profile)

    return profile
  }
}
```

Our next handler will be getting an individual profile by its `id`. This will accept an `id` and will return either the found profile or throw a not found exception.

```typescript
// profile/profile.service.ts

@Injectable()
export class ProfileService {
  ...

  async getProfile(id: string): Promise<Profile> {
    const profile = await profiles.doc(id).get();

    if (!profile) {
      throw new NotFoundException();
    }

    return profile;
  }
}
```

We will then write a handler for getting all the profiles in the collection. This will return a list of profiles, an empty list if there are no profiles.

```typescript
// profile/profile.service.ts

@Injectable()
export class ProfileService {
  ...

  async getProfiles(): Promise<Profile[]> {
    const profileDocuments = await profiles.query().fetch();

    return profileDocuments.documents.map((d) => d.content);
  }
}
```

The final handler we will write is for deleting an individual profile by its `id`.

```typescript
// profile.service.ts

@Injectable()
export class ProfileService {
  ...

  async deleteProfile(id: string): Promise<void> {
    await profiles.doc(id).delete();
  }
}
```

## Adding Nitric

To run the application locally using Nitric, and to eventually deploy the application, we will need to create a `nitric.yaml` file. This contains the name of the project, and a file path to the main entrypoint to the application.

```yaml
name: nest-x-nitric
handlers:
  - src/main.ts
```

We then want to add the `http` type to our main function, and pass in the Nest.js application. The `http` wrapper will use the `bootstrap` function when starting the application and pass it the port.

<Note>
  The application port will be set by the NITRIC_HTTP_PROXY_PORT environment
  variable, however it will find an open port if that environment variable isn't
  set.
</Note>

```typescript
// app.module.ts

import { http } from '@nitric/sdk'
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core'
import { AppModule } from './app.module'

async function bootstrap(port: number) {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule)
  await app.listen(port)
}

http(bootstrap)
```

## Creating the ProfileController

Now that the service is built, we can use the ProfileService with our ProfileController routing. This involves correctly extracting the parameters from the request object to then pass into the service functions.

```typescript
// profile/profile.controller.ts

import { Controller, Get, Post, Delete, Param, Req } from '@nestjs/common'
import { Profile, ProfileService } from './profile.service'
import { Request } from 'express'

@Controller()
export class ProfileController {
  constructor(private readonly profileService: ProfileService) {}

  @Get('/profiles')
  async getProfiles() {
    return await this.profileService.getProfiles()
  }

  @Get('/profile/:id')
  async getProfile(@Param('id') id: string) {
    return await this.profileService.getProfile(id)
  }

  @Post('/profile')
  async createProfile(@Req() req: Request<Omit<Profile, 'id'>>) {
    return await this.profileService.createProfile(req.body)
  }

  @Delete('/profile/:id')
  async deleteProfile(@Param('id') id: string) {
    return await this.profileService.deleteProfile(id)
  }
}
```

## Test locally

We can test that this works by running `nitric start` in one terminal, followed by `yarn start` in another. This will register the application with Nitric so you can verify it is working locally.

```
nitric start

SUCCESS  Started Local Services! (1s)
Local running, use ctrl-C to stop

Proxy | Endpoint
8000  | http://localhost:4001

Dev Dashboard | http://localhost:49152
```

You can use any http client to test the application. The application will be running from a random port, but proxied on port 4001. It is important that http://localhost:4001 correctly wraps your application.

We can test that a create request works by using the following cURL command.

```
curl  -X POST \
  'http://localhost:4001/profile' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "name": "Peter Parker",
  "age": 17,
  "homeTown": "Queens, New York City"
}'
```

It should return something similar to this:

```json
{
  "id": "2cbaeaf5-9339-44c4-a396-606a0d3910d9",
  "name": "Peter Parker",
  "age": 17,
  "homeTown": "Queens, New York City"
}
```

Using that id we can then make a get request to get the profile (replace the `id` param with the `id` from above).

```
curl http://localhost:4001/profile/2cbaeaf5-9339-44c4-a396-606a0d3910d9
```

It should return:

```json
{
  "id": "2cbaeaf5-9339-44c4-a396-606a0d3910d9",
  "name": "Peter Parker",
  "age": 17,
  "homeTown": "Queens, New York City"
}
```

## Deploy to the cloud

If you're ready, you can deploy the application to AWS, Azure or Google Cloud. For this example, we'll show the steps for AWS, but they're essentially the same in all cases.

The application code is ready to deploy as is, however a stack first needs to be defined. Stacks are essentially named deployment targets, which represent instances of your application running in the cloud.

You can create a new stack by running `nitric stack new` and following the prompts. In this case, we'll call the stack `awsdev`, select `aws` as the target cloud and `us-east-1` as the target region:

```txt
nitric stack new
? What should we name this stack? awsdev
? Which provider do you want to deploy with? aws
? Which region should the stack deploy to? us-east-1
```

Finally, run the `up` command to deploy the stack and push your code to the cloud:

```bash
nitric up
```

You can use the URL returned from the `up` command to make requests to your newly deployed application. If you want to make further changes to your application just run `nitric up` again and only the difference will be deployed.

When you're done with your application, you can destroy it using the command:

```bash
nitric down
```
