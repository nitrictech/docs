# Building a REST API with Nitric

This guide will show you how to build a serverless REST API with the Nitric framework using Node.js. The example API enables reading, writing and editing basic user profile information using a Nitric [collection](/collections) to store user data. Once the API is created we'll test it locally, then optionally deploy it to a cloud of your choice.

The API will provide the following routes:

| **Method** | **Route**      | **Description**                  |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `GET`      | /profiles/[id] | Get a specific profile by its Id |
| `GET`      | /profiles      | List all profiles                |
| `POST`     | /profiles      | Create a new profile             |
| `DELETE`   | /profiles/[id] | Delete a profile                 |
| `PUT`      | /profiles/[id] | Update a profile                 |

There is also an extended section of the guide that adds file operations using a Nitric [bucket](/storage) to store and retrieve profile pictures. The extension adds these routes to the API:

| **Method** | **Route**                    | **Description**                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `GET`      | /profiles/[id]/image/upload  | Get a profile image upload URL    |
| `GET`      | profiles/[id]/image/download | Get a profile image download URL  |
| `GET`      | profiles/[id]/image/view     | View the image that is downloaded |

## Video

Here's a video of this guide built with Node.js - [Build and Deploy a REST API for any Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/embed/PpIxtKDoL2Q).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- The [Nitric CLI](/guides/getting-started/installation)
- An [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) account (_your choice_)

## Getting started

Let's start by creating a new project from a Nitric TypeScript template, this will provide a base to start building the API.

```bash
nitric new my-profile-api "official/TypeScript - Starter"
```

Next, open the project in your editor of choice.

```bash
cd my-profile-api
```

Make sure all dependencies are resolved:

Using NPM:

```bash
npm install
```

The scaffolded project should have the following structure:

```text
functions/
├── hello.ts
node_modules/
nitric.yaml
package.json
README.md
```

You can test the project to verify everything is working as expected:

```bash
npm run dev
```

<Note>
  The `dev` script starts the Nitric Server using `nitric start`, which provides
  local interfaces to emulate cloud resources, then runs your functions allowing
  them to connect to the server.
</Note>

If everything's working you can now delete all files in the `functions/` folder, we'll create new functions in this guide.

## Building the API

This example uses UUIDs to create unique IDs to store profiles against, let's start by adding a library to help with that:

```bash
npm install uuid
```

Applications built with Nitric can contain many APIs, let's start by adding one to this project to serve as the public endpoint. Create a file named `profiles.ts` in the functions directory and add the following code to that file.

```javascript {{ tag: "functions/profiles.ts" }}
import { api, collection } from '@nitric/sdk'
import { v4 as uuid } from 'uuid'

// Create an API named 'public'
const profileApi = api('public')

// Define a collection named 'profiles', then request reading and writing permissions.
const profiles = collection('profiles').for('writing', 'reading')
```

Here we're creating an API named `public` and collection named `profiles`, then requesting read and write permissions which allows our function to access the collection.

<Note>
  Resources in Nitric like `api` and `collection` represent high-level cloud
  resources. When your app is deployed Nitric automatically converts these
  requests into appropriate resources for the specific
  [provider](/reference/providers). Nitric also takes care of adding the IAM
  roles, policies, etc. that grant the requested access. For example the
  `collection` resource uses DynamoDB in AWS or FireStore on Google Cloud.
</Note>

### Create profiles with POST

Let's start adding features that allow our API consumers to work with profile data.

<Note>
  You could separate some or all of these handlers into their own files if you
  prefer. For simplicity we'll group them together in this guide.
</Note>

```javascript
profileApi.post('/profiles', async (ctx) => {
  let id = uuid()

  // Store the new profile in the profiles collection
  await profiles.doc(id).set({
    name: ctx.req.json().name,
    age: ctx.req.json().age,
    homeTown: ctx.req.json().homeTown,
  })

  // Set a JSON HTTP response
  ctx.res.json({
    msg: `Profile with id $[id] created.`,
  })
})
```

### Retrieve a profile with GET

```javascript
profileApi.get('/profiles/:id', async (ctx) => {
  const { id } = ctx.req.params

  try {
    // Retrieve and return the profile data
    const profile = await profiles.doc(id).get()
    return ctx.res.json(profile)
  } catch (error) {
    // log errors and return a Not Found status.
    console.error(error)
    ctx.res.status = 404
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Profile with id $[id] not found.`,
    })
  }
})
```

### List all profiles with GET

```typescript
profileApi.get('/profiles', async (ctx) => {
  // Return all profiles
  ctx.res.json({
    output: await profiles.query().fetch(),
  })
})
```

### Remove a profile with DELETE

```typescript
profileApi.delete('/profiles/:id', async (ctx) => {
  const { id } = ctx.req.params

  // Delete the profile
  try {
    profiles.doc(id).delete()
  } catch (error) {
    ctx.res.status = 404
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Profile with id $[id] not found.`,
    })
  }
})
```

## Ok, let's run this thing!

Now that you have an API defined with handlers for each of its methods, it's time to test it locally.

```bash
npm run dev
```

<Note>
  the `dev` script starts the Nitric Server using `nitric start`, which provides
  local interfaces to emulate cloud resources, then runs your functions and
  allows them to connect.
</Note>

Once it starts, the application will receive requests via the API port. You can use the Local Dashboard or any HTTP client to test the API. We'll keep it running for our tests. If you want to update your functions, just save them, they'll be reloaded automatically.

## Test the API

Below are some example requests you can use to test the API. You'll need to update all values in brackets `[]` and change the URL to your deployed URL if you're testing on the cloud.

### Create Profile

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:4001/profiles' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "Peter Parker",
    "age": "21",
    "homeTown" : "Queens"
}'
```

### Fetch Profile

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]'
```

### Fetch All Profiles

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles'
```

### Delete Profile

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]'
```

## Deploy to the cloud

At this point, you can deploy the application to any supported cloud provider. Start by setting up your credentials and any configuration for the cloud you prefer:

- [AWS](/reference/providers/aws)
- [Azure](/reference/providers/azure)
- [Google Cloud](/reference/providers/gcp)

Next, we'll need to create a `stack`. Stacks represent deployed instances of an application, including the target provider and other details such as the deployment region. You'll usually define separate stacks for each environment such as development, testing and production. For now, let's start by creating a `dev` stack.

```bash
nitric stack new
```

```
? What should we name this stack? dev
? Which provider do you want to deploy with? aws
? Which region should the stack deploy to? us-east-1
```

### AWS

<Note>
  Cloud deployments incur costs and while most of these resource are available
  with free tier pricing you should consider the costs of the deployment.
</Note>

In the previous step we called our stack `dev`, let's try deploying it with the `up` command.

```bash
nitric up
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
| API  | Endpoint                                               |
| main | https://XXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com   |
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

When the deployment is complete, go to the relevant cloud console and you'll be able to see and interact with your API. If you'd like to make changes to the API you can apply those changes by rerunning the `up` command. Nitric will automatically detect what's changed and just update the relevant cloud resources.

When you're done testing your application you can tear it down from the cloud, use the `down` command:

```bash
nitric down
```

## Optional - Add profile image upload/download support

If you want to go a bit deeper and create some other resources with Nitric, why not add images to your profiles API.

### Access profile buckets with permissions

Define a bucket named `profilesImg` with reading/writing permissions.

```javascript
const profilesImg = bucket('profilesImg').for('reading', 'writing')
```

### Get a URL to upload a profile image

```javascript
profileApi.get('/profiles/:id/image/upload', async (ctx) => {
  const id = ctx.req.params['id']

  // Return a signed upload URL, which provides temporary access to upload a file.
  const photoUrl = await profilesImg
    .file(`images/$[id]/photo.png`)
    .getUploadUrl()
  ctx.res.json({
    url: photoUrl,
  })
})
```

### Get a URL to download a profile image

```typescript
profileApi.get('/profiles/:id/image/download', async (ctx) => {
  const id = ctx.req.params['id']

  // Return a signed download URL, which provides temporary access to download a file.
  const photoUrl = await profilesImg
    .file(`images/$[id]/photo.png`)
    .getDownloadUrl()
  ctx.res.json({
    url: photoUrl,
  })
})
```

You can also return a redirect response that takes the HTTP client directly to the photo URL.

```typescript
profileApi.get('/profiles/:id/image/view', async (ctx) => {
  const { id } = ctx.req.params

  // Redirect to a signed read-only file URL.
  const photoUrl = await profilesImg
    .file(`images/$[id]/photo.png`)
    .getDownloadUrl()
  ctx.res.status = 303
  ctx.res.headers['Location'] = [photoUrl]
})
```

#### Test the extended API

Update all values in brackets `[]` and change the URL to your deployed URL if you're testing on the cloud.

#### Get an image upload URL

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]/image/upload'
```

#### Using the upload URL with curl

```bash
curl --location --request PUT '[url]' \
--header 'content-type: image/png' \
--data-binary '@/home/user/Pictures/photo.png'

```

#### Get an image download URL

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]/image/download'
```
