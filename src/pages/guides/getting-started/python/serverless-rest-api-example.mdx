# Building your first API with Nitric

## What we'll be doing

1. Use Nitric to create an API to create and update profiles
2. Create handlers for the following API operations

| **Method** | **Route**      | **Description**                  |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `GET`      | /profiles/[id] | Get a specific profile by its Id |
| `GET`      | /profiles      | List all profiles                |
| `POST`     | /profiles      | Create a new profile             |
| `DELETE`   | /profiles/[id] | Delete a profile                 |
| `PUT`      | /profiles/[id] | Update a profile                 |

3. Run locally for testing
4. Deploy to a cloud of your choice
5. (Optional) Add handlers for the following API operations

| **Method** | **Route**                    | **Description**                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `GET`      | /profiles/[id]/image/upload  | Get a profile image upload URL   |
| `GET`      | profiles/[id]/image/download | Get a profile image download URL |

Here's a video of this guide built with Node.js:

[Build and Deploy a REST API for any Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/embed/PpIxtKDoL2Q)

## Prerequisites

- [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) - for simplified dependency management
- The [Nitric CLI](/guides/getting-started/installation)
- An [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) account (_your choice_)

## Getting started

We'll start by creating a new project for our API.

```bash
nitric new
```

Create a project, name it and select your preferred starter template.

```bash
? What is the name of the project? my-profile-api
? Choose a template: official/Python - Starter
```

Next, open the project in your editor of choice.

```bash
> cd my-profile-api
```

Make sure all dependencies are resolved:

Using Pipenv:

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

The scaffolded project should have the following structure:

```text
+--functions/
|  +-- hello.py
+--nitric.yaml
+--Pipfile
+--Pipfile.lock
+--README.md
```

You can test the project to verify everything is working as expected:

Start the Nitric server to emulate cloud services on your machine:

```bash
nitric start
```

Next, in a new terminal window, you can run your application:

```bash
pipenv run dev
```

If everything is working as expected you can now delete all files in the `functions/` folder, we'll create new functions in this guide.

## Building the Profile API

Let's start building our profiles API. Create a file named 'profiles.py' in the functions directory and add the following:

```python
from uuid import uuid4

from nitric.resources import api, collection, bucket
from nitric.application import Nitric

# Create an api named public
profile_api = api("public")

# Access profile collection with permissions
profiles = collection('profiles').allow('reading','writing')
```

Here we're creating:

- An API named `public`,
- A collection named `profiles` and giving our function permission to read and write to that collection.

From here, let's add some features to that function that allow us to work with profiles.

> _Note:_ You could separate some or all of these request handlers their own functions if you prefer. For simplicity we'll group them together in this guide.

### Create profiles with POST

```python
@profile_api.post("/profiles")
async def create_profile(ctx):
  pid = str(uuid4())
  name = ctx.req.json['name']
  age = ctx.req.json['age']
  hometown = ctx.req.json['homeTown']

  await profiles.doc(pid).set({ 'name': name, 'age': age, 'hometown': hometown} )

  ctx.res.body = { 'msg': f'Profile with id {pid} created.'}
```

### Retrieve a profile with GET

```python
@profile_api.get("/profiles/:id")
async def get_profile(ctx):
  pid = ctx.req.params['id']
  d = await profiles.doc(pid).get()

  ctx.res.body = f"{d.content}"

```

### List all profiles with GET

```python
@profile_api.get("/profiles")
async def get_profiles(ctx):
  results = await profiles.query().fetch()
  r = [doc.content for doc in results.documents]
  ctx.res.body = f"{r}"
```

### Remove a profile with DELETE

```python
@profile_api.delete("/profiles/:id")
async def delete_profiles(ctx):
  pid = ctx.req.params['id']

  try:
    d = await profiles.doc(pid).delete()
    ctx.res.body = { 'msg': f'Profile with id {pid} deleted.'}
  except:
    ctx.res.status = 404
    ctx.res.body = { 'msg': f'Profile with id {pid} not found.'}

Nitric.run()
```

## Ok, let's run this thing!

Now that you have an API defined with handlers for each of its methods, it's time to test it locally.

Start the Nitric server to emulate cloud services on your machine:

```bash
nitric start
```

Next, in a new terminal window, you can run your application:

```bash
pipenv run dev
```

Once it starts, the application will receive requests via the API port. You can use cURL, Postman or any other HTTP client to test the API.

We will keep it running for our tests. If you want to update your functions, just save them, they'll be reloaded automatically.

## Test your API

Update all values in brackets `[]` and change the URL to your deployed URL if you're testing on the cloud.

### Create Profile

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:4001/profiles' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "Peter Parker",
    "age": "21",
    "homeTown" : "Queens"
}'
```

### Fetch Profile

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]'
```

### Fetch All Profiles

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles'
```

### Delete Profile

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]'
```

## Deploy to the cloud

At this point, you can deploy what you've built to any of the supported cloud providers. To do this start by setting up your credentials and any configuration for the cloud you prefer:

- [AWS](/reference/providers/aws)
- [Azure](/reference/providers/azure)
- [GCP](/reference/providers/gcp)

Next, we'll need to create a `stack`. A stack represents a deployed instance of an application, which is a collection of resources defined in your project. You might want separate stacks for each environment, such as stacks for `dev`, `test` and `prod`. For now, let's start by creating a `dev` stack.

```bash
nitric stack new
```

```
? What do you want to call your new stack? dev
? Which Cloud do you wish to deploy to? aws
? select the region us-east-1
```

### AWS

> Note: You are responsible for staying within the limits of the free tier or any costs associated with deployment.

We called our stack `dev`, let's try deploying it with the `up` command

```bash
nitric up
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
| API  | Endpoint                                               |
| main | https://XXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com   |
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

When the deployment is complete, go to the relevant cloud console and you'll be able to see and interact with your API.

To tear down your application from the cloud, use the `down` command:

```bash
nitric down
```

## Optional - Add profile image upload/download support

If you want to go a bit deeper and create some other resources with Nitric, why not add images to your profiles API.

### Access profile buckets with permissions

Define a bucket named `profilesImg` with reading/writing permissions

```python
photos = bucket("photos").allow('reading','writing')
```

Add imports for time and date so that we can set up caching/expiry headers

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

### Get a URL to upload a profile image

```python
@profile_api.get("/profiles/:id/image/upload")
async def upload_profile_image(ctx):

  pid = ctx.req.params['id']

  photo =  photos.file(f'images/{pid}/photo.png')
  photo_url = await photo.upload_url(expiry=3600)

  expires = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(seconds=(3600))
  expires = expires.strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S GMT")
  ctx.res.headers['Expires'] = expires

  ctx.res.body = photo_url
```

### Get a URL to download a profile image

```python
@profile_api.get("/profiles/:id/image/view")
async def download_profile_image(ctx):
  pid = ctx.req.params['id']

  photo =  photos.file(f'images/{pid}/photo.png')
  photo_url = await photo.download_url(expiry=3600)

  expires = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(seconds=(3600))
  expires = expires.strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S GMT")
  ctx.res.headers['Expires'] = expires

  ctx.res.body = photo_url
```

You can also directly redirect to the photo URL.

```python
@profile_api.get("/profiles/:id/image/view")
async def download_profile_image(ctx):
  pid = ctx.req.params['id']

  photo =  photos.file(f'images/{pid}/photo.png')
  photo_url = await photo.download_url(expiry=3600)

  expires = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(seconds=(3600))
  expires = expires.strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S GMT")
  ctx.res.headers['Expires'] = expires
  ctx.res.headers['Location'] = [photo_url]
  ctx.res.status = 303
```

#### Time to test the updated API

Update all values in brackets `[]` and change the URL to your deployed URL if you're testing on the cloud.

#### Get an image upload URL

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]/image/upload'
```

#### Using the upload URL with curl

```bash
curl --location --request PUT '[url]' \
--header 'content-type: image/png' \
--data-binary '@/home/user/Pictures/photo.png'

```

#### Get an image download URL

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]/image/download'
```
