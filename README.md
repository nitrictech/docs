> **This repository has been archived. The documentation has been moved to the [main Nitric repository](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric).**

## Documentation Location

The official Nitric documentation is now maintained in the main Nitric repository:

- [Nitric Documentation](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/tree/main/docs)
- [Live Documentation Site](https://nitric.io/docs)

## Why This Change?

We've consolidated our documentation into the main Nitric repository to:

- Improve maintainability
- Keep documentation closer to the codebase
- Streamline our development workflow
- Provide a single source of truth for all Nitric resources

Please update any bookmarks or references to point to the new documentation location.
