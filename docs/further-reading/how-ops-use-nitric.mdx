# How Ops use Nitric

![diagram](/docs/images/concepts/ops-workflow.svg)

## Nitric CLI and Server

Deploying with Nitric is as simple as running the `nitric up` command. The Nitric CLI then initiates the deployment process by generating the resource specification detailing the current runtime requirements of the application.

Next, the Nitric Server orchestrates the deployment process, ensuring that all necessary resources defined in the resource specification are provisioned and configured correctly. It does this by creating a mapping between the resource specification and IaC Providers, based on a lightweight configuration file that contains details of the target cloud, region and any overrides to default services like timeouts or memory.

## Nitric Providers

Providers are deployment and runtime plugins that target a cloud (or other host) and the specific services of that host that are chosen to fulfill each of the resources defined in the resource specification (such as a container runtime, buckets, key/value stores, API gateways, queues, etc.)

Providers consist of a Deployment Engine, which automatically deploys your cloud resources, and a Runtime Adapter, which handles requests from the SDKs and forwards them to appropriate cloud service APIs.

Nitric has [fully supported Provider implementations](/reference/providers#standard-providers) for AWS, Google Cloud and Azure, as well as capabilities to extend or customize them by building [custom providers](/reference/providers/custom/building-custom-provider). Custom providers can utilize any IaC tools to target these or other clouds such as Digital Ocean or Oracle.

<Note>
  The local runtime emulation feature described in the development section is
  also a provider which allows you to run your code on your own machine during
  development.

## Container Images

The Nitric CLI uses Docker to build container images of the application. The containers that are built during deployment include a copy of the runtime implementation for the provider. As with most of the components in the Nitric framework, the containerization process can be [customized](/reference/custom-containers).

The runtime server is a lightweight adapter that translates requests from the Nitric SDK to the cloud-specific APIs in your provider. It also listens for events/requests from the cloud provider, such as HTTP requests or messages on a topic, and forwards them to your application code in a common format.
