# Project structure

Nitric doesn't enforce a strict project structure. By default, Nitric only requires a `nitric.yaml` file to identify the project and a `nitric.[stack ID].yaml` file to define the deployment target. However, Nitric projects can be organized in a way that makes sense for you or your team.

We recommend starting with a project template, using the `nitric new` CLI command. These templates often contain an opinionated project structure, to get you started quickly. You can then modify the project structure to suit your needs.

## Basic structure

Here are some examples of basic Nitric project structures:

<CodeWithTabs>

```text !!tabs Go
my-project/
├── nitric.yaml
├── nitric.aws.yaml
└── services/
    ├── service1/
    │   └── main.go
    └── service2/
        └── main.go
```

```text !!tabs JavaScript
my-project/
├── nitric.yaml
├── nitric.aws.yaml
└── services/
    ├── service1.js
    └── service2.js
```

```text !!tabs Python
my-project/
├── nitric.yaml
├── nitric.aws.yaml
└── services/
    ├── service1.py
    └── service2.py
```

</CodeWithTabs>

This flexibility allows you to organize your project in a way that makes sense for you or your team. For example, you may build a single monolithic service, multiple microservices, or something else entirely.

<Note>
  The `services` directory is a common convention for Nitric projects, but you
  can organize your project however you like.

## Project file

The existence of a `nitric.yaml` file, indicates that the directory contains a project built with Nitric. The file defines the project's name and how to locate and run the entrypoints to your application (services). You can read about the `nitric.yaml` file in the [configuration](/basics/configuration) section.

## Stack files

Nitric projects can be deployed to multiple environments and cloud providers; stack files identify these deployment targets. These files can be created by running the `nitric stack new` CLI command. You can read more about stack files in the [deployment](/basics/deployment) section.
