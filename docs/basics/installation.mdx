# Installation

## Prerequisites

Nitric relies on functionality from the following projects to help retrieve plugins, containerize and deploy your application.
Please follow these links to the official installation steps for each.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx/)
- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/cli/) _(for deployments, only needed if using the default providers)_

<Note>
  When setting up docker on Linux be sure to follow the [post-installation
  steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) so you can
  run docker as a non-root user.
</Note>
