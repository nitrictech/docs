# Websites

Nitric provides a simple way to deploy websites to the cloud, allowing you to serve website assets in a serverless environment without managing complex infrastructure.

If you're interested in the architecture, provisioning, or deployment steps, they can be found [here](/architecture/websites).

<Note>
  At this time, websites can only be deployed as static assets. If you require
  more advanced features, let us know:

</Note>

## Overview

Nitricâ€™s website resource lets you:

- Serve static files (HTML, JS, CSS, images) from cloud storage.
- Service your entire nitric application from a single domain.
- APIs are automatically served under `/api` and websites are served under `/`.
- Deploy to various supported providers with minimal configuration.
- Use infrastructure from code to keep your environment consistent.

## Enabling Websites

Websites are currently in [Preview](/reference/preview-features). To enable this feature in your project add the following to your `nitric.yaml` file.

```yaml
preview:
  - websites
```

## Create a Website

### 1. Create your website project

Create a new website project using your preferred framework. For example, using [Astro](https://astro.build/) within your nitric project:

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-website
```

### 2. Add a website resources

Add a website resource to your `nitric.yaml` file.

```yaml
websites:
  - basedir: ./my-website
    build:
      command: npm run build
      output: ./dist
    dev:
      command: npm run dev -- --port 4322
      url: http://localhost:4322
```

### 3. Start your website locally

Run `nitric start` to start your website locally. This will use the `dev` configuration, which proxies requests to your local development server.

Run `nitric run` command to run your production website locally. This will use the `build` configuration and serve the static files.

### 4. Deploy your website

Run `nitric up` to deploy your website to the cloud.

## Sub Sites

You can also configure sub-sites under different paths. These will be deployed as subdirectories of the main site.

Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
websites:
  - basedir: ./my-website
    build:
      command: npm run build
      output: ./dist
    dev:
      command: npm run dev -- --port 4322
      url: http://localhost:4322
  # the sub site is served under /docs, ensure you do not have conflicting routes
  - basedir: ./docs-website
    path: /docs
    build:
      command: npm run build
      output: ./dist
    dev:
      command: npm run dev -- --port 4323
      url: http://localhost:4323
```

## Configuration

Here is a breakdown of the configuration options:

```yaml
websites:
  - # The path to the website project directory
    basedir: ./my-website
    # The path to the website when deployed
    path: /
    # The default file to serve when no file is specified
    index: index.html
    # The file to serve when a 404 error occurs
    error: 404.html
    # The build options for the website
    build:
      # The command to build your website
      command: npm run build
      # The output directory for the build command
      output: ./dist
    # dev configuration is used by the `nitric start` command
    dev:
      # The command to run your website locally
      command: npm run dev -- --port 4322
      # The URL to access your website locally
      url: http://localhost:4322
```

## Cloud Service Mapping

Each cloud provider comes with a set of default services used when deploying resources. You can find the default services for each cloud provider below.

- [AWS](/providers/mappings/aws/websites)
- [Azure](/providers/mappings/azure/websites)
- Google Cloud - Not implemented

If you need support for additional clouds or website types, let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/issues) or joining the conversation on [Discord](https://nitric.io/chat).
