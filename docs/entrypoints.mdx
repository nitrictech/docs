Nitric allows you to map a number of resources that can be hosted together and a single frontend/origin.

### How it works

Nitric entrypoints can be mapped to a number of managed services in the cloud in order to facilitate single origin application routing
and unlock CDN capability.

### Adding a new Entrypoint

Entrypoints are defined in a projects nitric.yaml file.

Supported resource types for entrypoints are:

- [Services/Functions](./services)
- [Sites](./sites)
- [Apis](./api-gateways)

> When defining entrypoints a default entrypoint `'/'` **MUST** be specified

### APIs as entrypoints

When adding an API as a non-default entrypoint it is important that the leading part of the entrypoint path **MUST** match the leading part of the API path.

```

### Adding a Domain to entrypoints
Custom domains can be added to entrypoints, and will be configured for clouds you deploy to

To define a domain for an entrypoint, you need to add it under `domains`.

```yaml
# Define nitric application entrypoints here
entrypoints:
  main:
    paths:
      /:
        target: app
        type: site
      # 👎 Doesn't match the base path of the above API
      /myapi/:
        target: exampleapi
        type: api
    domains:
      - example.com
```

> Adding domains may require additional configuration to update DNS records, this can vary between cloud providers.

### Testing your entrypoints

The easiest way to test your entrypoints locally is via the nitric run command. This will deploy an additional frontend along with your other stack
resources in order to serve your stack under a single origin.

`nitric dev run`

In the output you should receive a link that indicates where you can reach your application via the nitric entrypoints.

`Your application entrypoint is available at http://localhost:<port>`
