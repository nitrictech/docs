# Building a GraphQL API with Nitric

## What we'll be doing

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org) APIs rely on only one HTTP endpoint, which means that you want it to be reliable, scalable, and performant. By using serverless compute such as Lambda, the GraphQL endpoint can be auto-scaling, whilst maintaining performance and reliability.

We'll be using Nitric to create a GraphQL API, that can be deployed to a cloud of your choice, gaining the benefits of serverless compute.

1. Create the GraphQL Schema
2. Write Resolvers
3. Create handler for GraphQL requests
4. Run locally for testing
5. Deploy to a cloud of your choice

## Prerequisites

- [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) - for simplified dependency management
- The [Nitric CLI](/getting-started/installation)
- _(optional)_ Your choice of an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) account

## Getting started

We'll start by creating a new project for our API.

```bash
nitric new my-profile-api py-starter
```

Next, open the project in your editor of choice.

```bash
cd my-profile-api
```

Make sure all dependencies are resolved:

Using Pipenv:

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

The scaffolded project should have the following structure:

```text
+--services/
|  +-- hello.py
+--nitric.yaml
+--Pipfile
+--Pipfile.lock
+--README.md
```

You can test the project to verify everything is working as expected:

Start the Nitric server to emulate cloud services on your machine:

```bash
nitric start
```

If everything is working as expected you can now delete all files in the `services/` folder, we'll create new services in this guide.

## Build the GraphQL Schema

GraphQL requests are typesafe, and so they require a schema to be defined to validate queries.

Let's first add the [Ariadne library](https://ariadnegraphql.org/)

```bash
pipenv install ariadne
```

Create a new file named 'graphql.py' in the services folder.
We can then import our dependencies, and write out the schema.

```python
from ariadne import MutationType, QueryType, gql, make_executable_schema, graphql
from uuid import uuid4

type_defs = gql("""
  type Profile {
    pid: String!
    name: String!
    age: Int!
    home: String!
  }

  type Message {
    msg: String!
  }

  input ProfileInput {
    name: String!
    age: Int!
    home: String!
  }

  type Query {
    getProfile(pid: String!): Profile
  }

  type Mutation {
    createProfile(profile: ProfileInput!): Profile
    updateProfile(pid: String!, profile: ProfileInput!): Profile
  }
""")
```

## Define a Key Value store

Lets define a key value store resource for the resolvers get/set data from.

```python
from nitric.resources import api, kv
from nitric.application import Nitric

profiles = kv('profiles').allow('get','set')
```

## Create Resolvers

We'll need to map our resolvers to mutations or queries using Ariadne's QueryType or MutationType.

```python
query = QueryType()
mutation = MutationType()
```

We can then use the key value store within these services. Each resolver will receive a parent and info arguments, as well as any query or mutation's arguments as keyword arguments.

An example of this is converting the GraphQL query function into Python:

```graphql
updateProfile(pid: String!, profile: ProfileInput!): Profile
```

```python
@mutation.field("updateProfile")
async def update_profiles(obj, info, pid, profile):
  pass
```

## Create a profile

```python
@mutation.field("createProfile")
async def resolve_create_profile(obj, info, profile):
  pid = str(uuid4())

  p = { 'pid': pid, 'name': profile['name'], 'age': profile['age'], 'home': profile['home'] }
  await profiles.set(pid, p)

  return p
```

## Update a profile

```python
@mutation.field("updateProfile")
async def update_profiles(obj, info, pid, profile):
  profile = await profiles.get(pid)
  if profile is None:
    return { 'msg': f'Profile with id {pid} not found.'}

  p = { 'pid': pid, 'name': profile['name'], 'age': profile['age'], 'home': profile['home'] }
  await profiles.doc(pid).set(p)

  return p
```

## Get a profile by its ID

```python
@query.field("getProfile")
async def resolve_get_profile(obj, info, pid):
  profile = await profiles.get(pid)
  return { 'pid': pid, 'name': profile['name'], 'age': profile['age'], 'home': profile['home'] }
```

## GraphQL Handler

We'll define an API to put our handler in. This API will only have one endpoint, which will handle all the requests.

First load the schema with our queries and mutations.

```python
from nitric.resources import kv, api
from nitric.application import Nitric

graph_api = api("public")
schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs, [query, mutation])

Nitric.run()
```

Then add the API handler.

```python
@graph_api.post("/")
async def profile_handler(ctx: HttpContext) -> None:
    query = ctx.req.json

    success, result = await graphql(
        schema,
        query
    )

    ctx.res.status = 200 if success else 400
    ctx.res.body = result

Nitric.run()
```

## Run it!

Now that you have an API defined with a handler for the GraphQL requests, it's time to test it out locally.

Start your Nitric server:

```bash
nitric start
```

Then test out your service with the following command in a new terminal:

```bash
pipenv run dev
```

Once it starts, the service will be able to receive requests via the API port.

## GraphQL Queries

We can use cURL, postman or any other HTTP Client to test our application, however it's better if the client has GraphQL support.

### Get all Profiles using cURL

```bash
curl --location -X POST \
  'http://localhost:4001' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"query":"query { getProfiles { pid name age home }}","variables":{}}'
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getProfiles": [
      {
        "pid": "3f70ca58-25ed-4e88-8a45-eea1fbbb45d8",
        "name": "Tony Stark",
        "age": 53,
        "home": "Manhattan, New York City"
      },
      {
        "pid": "9c53bd95-199c-4151-a2a6-0da3ae24c29d",
        "name": "Peter Parker",
        "age": 22,
        "home": "Queens, New York City"
      },
      {
        "pid": "9ff191b0-0fbe-4e49-b944-85e79b5caa21",
        "name": "Steve Rogers",
        "age": 105,
        "home": "New York City"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Get a single profile

```bash
curl --location -X POST \
  'http://localhost:4001' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"query":"query { getProfile(pid: \"3f70ca58-25ed-4e88-8a45-eea1fbbb45d8\") { pid name age home }}","variables":{}}'

```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getProfile": {
      "pid": "3f70ca58-25ed-4e88-8a45-eea1fbbb45d8",
      "name": "Tony Stark",
      "age": 53,
      "home": "Manhattan, New York City"
    }
  }
}
```

### Create a profile

```bash
curl --location -X POST \
  'http://localhost:4001' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"query":"mutation { createProfile(profile: { name: \"Tony Stark\", age: 53, home: \"Manhattan, New York City\" }){ pid name age home }}","variables":{}}'
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getProfile": {
      "pid": "3f70ca58-25ed-4e88-8a45-eea1fbbb45d8",
      "name": "Tony Stark",
      "age": 53,
      "home": "Manhattan, New York City"
    }
  }
}
```

### Update a profile

```bash
curl --location -X POST \
  'http://localhost:4001' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"query":"mutation { updateProfile(pid: \"3f70ca58-25ed-4e88-8a45-eea1fbbb45d8\",profile: { name: \"Peter Parker\", age: 22, home: \"Queens, New York City\" }){ pid name age home }}","variables":{}}'
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getProfile": {
      "pid": "3f70ca58-25ed-4e88-8a45-eea1fbbb45d8",
      "name": "Peter Parker",
      "age": 22,
      "home": "Queens, New York City"
    }
  }
}
```

## Deploy to the cloud

Setup your credentials and any other cloud specific configuration:

- [AWS](/reference/providers/aws)
- [Azure](/reference/providers/azure)
- [GCP](/reference/providers/gcp)

Create your stack. This is an environment configuration file for the cloud provider for which your project will be deployed.

```bash
nitric stack new
```

You can then deploy using the following command:

```bash
nitric up
```

To undeploy run the following command:

```bash
nitric down
```
