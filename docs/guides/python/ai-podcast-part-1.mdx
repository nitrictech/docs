# Building an AI podcast with Nitric - Part 1

## What we'll be doing

In this guide we'll be building the first of many parts to create a fully autonomous AI podcast.

This part will focus on generating long form audio content from text using the Nitric Batch service.

By the end of this guide we'll have a project that will be able to produce audio content from text input.

Here is a sample of what we'll be able to produce:

{/* Add audio clip here */}

<audio controls>
  <source src="audio/dead-internet-podcast.m4a" type="audio/x-m4a" />
</audio>{' '}

## Prerequisites

- [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) - for simplified dependency management
- The [Nitric CLI](/get-started/installation)
- _(optional)_ Your choice of an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) or [GCP](https://cloud.google.com)

## Getting started
