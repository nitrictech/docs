# Building a REST API with Nitric

This guide will show you how to build a serverless REST API with the Nitric framework using Node.js. The example API enables getting, setting and editing basic user profile information using a Nitric [key value store](/keyvalue) to store user data. Once the API is created we'll test it locally, then optionally deploy it to a cloud of your choice.

The API will provide the following routes:

| **Method** | **Route**      | **Description**                  |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `GET`      | /profiles/[id] | Get a specific profile by its Id |
| `POST`     | /profiles      | Create a new profile             |
| `DELETE`   | /profiles/[id] | Delete a profile                 |

There is also an extended section of the guide that adds file operations using a Nitric [bucket](/storage) to store and retrieve profile pictures. The extension adds these routes to the API:

| **Method** | **Route**                    | **Description**                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `GET`      | /profiles/[id]/image/upload  | Get a profile image upload URL    |
| `GET`      | profiles/[id]/image/download | Get a profile image download URL  |
| `GET`      | profiles/[id]/image/view     | View the image that is downloaded |

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- The [Nitric CLI](/getting-started/installation)
- _(optional)_ Your choice of an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) account

## Getting started

Let's start by creating a new project from a Nitric TypeScript template, this will provide a base to start building the API.

```bash
nitric new my-profile-api ts-starter
```

Next, open the project in your editor of choice.

```bash
cd my-profile-api
```

Make sure all dependencies are resolved:

Using NPM:

```bash
npm install
```

The scaffolded project should have the following structure:

```text
services/
├── hello.ts
node_modules/
nitric.yaml
package.json
README.md
```

You can test the project to verify everything is working as expected:

```bash
nitric start
```

If everything's working you can now delete all files in the `services/` folder, we'll create new services in this guide.

## Building the API

This example uses UUIDs to create unique IDs to store profiles against, let's start by adding a library to help with that:

```bash
npm install uuid
```

Applications built with Nitric can contain many APIs, let's start by adding one to this project to serve as the public endpoint. Create a file named `profiles.ts` in the services directory and add the following code to that file.

```javascript {{ tag: "services/profiles.ts" }}
import { api, kv } from '@nitric/sdk'
import { v4 as uuid } from 'uuid'

// Create an API named 'public'
const profileApi = api('public')

// Define a key value store named 'profiles', then request getting and setting permissions.
const profiles = kv('profiles').allow('get', 'set')
```

Here we're creating an API named `public` and key value store named `profiles`, then requesting get and set permissions which allows our function to access the key value store.

<Note>
  Resources in Nitric like `api` and `key value store` represent high-level
  cloud resources. When your app is deployed Nitric automatically converts these
  requests into appropriate resources for the specific
  [provider](/reference/providers). Nitric also takes care of adding the IAM
  roles, policies, etc. that grant the requested access. For example the `key
  value store` resource uses DynamoDB in AWS or FireStore on Google Cloud.
</Note>

We will need some helper functions to serialize and deserialize our profiles for the keyvalue store.

```javascript {{ tag: "services/profiles.ts" }}
// Helper function to get current profiles
async function getProfiles() {
  try {
    const serializedList = await profiles.get('profiles')
    return serializedList && serializedList['ids']
      ? JSON.parse(serializedList['ids'])
      : []
  } catch (error) {
    await profiles.set('profiles', { ids: [] })
    return []
  }
}

// Helper function to update profiles list
async function updateProfiles(profileList) {
  try {
    const updatedSerializedList = JSON.stringify(profileList)
    await profiles.set('profiles', { ids: updatedSerializedList })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating profiles:', error)
  }
}
```

### Create profiles with POST

Next we will add features that allow our API consumers to work with profile data.

<Note>
  You could separate some or all of these handlers into their own files if you
  prefer. For simplicity we'll group them together in this guide.
</Note>

```javascript {{ tag: "services/profiles.ts" }}
profileApi.post('/profiles', async (ctx) => {
  let id = uuid()
  const { name, age, homeTown } = ctx.req.json()

  const profileList = await getProfiles()
  profileList.push({
    id,
    name,
    age,
    homeTown,
  })
  await updateProfiles(profileList)

  // Set a JSON HTTP response
  ctx.res.json({
    msg: `Profile with id ${id} created.`,
  })
})
```

### Retrieve a profile with GET

```javascript {{ tag: "services/profiles.ts" }}
profileApi.get('/profiles/:id', async (ctx) => {
  const { id } = ctx.req.params

  try {
    const profileList = await getProfiles()
    const profile = profileList.find((profile) => profile.id === id)
    if (profile != undefined) {
      ctx.res.json(profile)
    } else {
      throw new Error()
    }
  } catch (error) {
    ctx.res.status = 404
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Profile with id ${id} not found.`,
    })
  }
})
```

### Remove a profile with DELETE

```javascript {{ tag: "services/profiles.ts" }}
profileApi.delete('/profiles/:id', async (ctx) => {
  const { id } = ctx.req.params
  try {
    const profileList = await getProfiles()
    await updateProfiles(profileList.filter((profile) => profile.id !== id))
  } catch (error) {
    ctx.res.status = 404
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Profile with id ${id} not found.`,
    })
  }
})
```

## Ok, let's run this thing!

Now that you have an API defined with handlers for each of its methods, it's time to test it locally.

```bash
nitric start
```

Once it starts, your services will receive requests via the API port. You can use the Local Dashboard or any HTTP client to test the API. We'll keep it running for our tests.

## Test the API

Below are some example requests you can use to test the API. You'll need to update all values in brackets `[]` and change the URL to your deployed URL if you're testing on the cloud.

### Create Profile

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:4001/profiles' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "Peter Parker",
    "age": "21",
    "homeTown" : "Queens"
}'
```

### Fetch Profile

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]'
```

### Delete Profile

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]'
```

## Deploy to the cloud

At this point, you can deploy the application to any supported cloud provider. Start by setting up your credentials and any configuration for the cloud you prefer:

- [AWS](/reference/providers/aws)
- [Azure](/reference/providers/azure)
- [Google Cloud](/reference/providers/gcp)

Next, we'll need to create a `stack`. Stacks represent deployed instances of an application, including the target provider and other details such as the deployment region. You'll usually define separate stacks for each environment such as development, testing and production.

```bash
nitric stack new dev
```

### AWS

<Note>
  Cloud deployments incur costs and while most of these resource are available
  with free tier pricing you should consider the costs of the deployment.
</Note>

We can deploy our application using the following command:

```bash
nitric up
```

When the deployment is complete, go to the relevant cloud console and you'll be able to see and interact with your API. If you'd like to make changes to the API you can apply those changes by re-running the `up` command. Nitric will automatically detect what's changed and just update the relevant cloud resources.

When you're done testing your application you can tear it down from the cloud, use the `down` command:

```bash
nitric down
```

## Optional - Add profile image upload/download support

If you want to go a bit deeper and create some other resources with Nitric, why not add images to your profiles API.

### Access profile buckets with permissions

Define a bucket named `profilesImg` with reading/writing permissions.

```javascript
const profilesImg = bucket('profilesImg').allow('read', 'write')
```

### Get a URL to upload a profile image

```javascript
profileApi.get('/profiles/:id/image/upload', async (ctx) => {
  const id = ctx.req.params['id']

  // Return a signed upload URL, which provides temporary access to upload a file.
  const photoUrl = await profilesImg
    .file(`images/${id}/photo.png`)
    .getUploadUrl()
  ctx.res.json({
    url: photoUrl,
  })
})
```

### Get a URL to download a profile image

```typescript
profileApi.get('/profiles/:id/image/download', async (ctx) => {
  const id = ctx.req.params['id']

  // Return a signed download URL, which provides temporary access to download a file.
  const photoUrl = await profilesImg
    .file(`images/${id}/photo.png`)
    .getDownloadUrl()
  ctx.res.json({
    url: photoUrl,
  })
})
```

You can also return a redirect response that takes the HTTP client directly to the photo URL.

```typescript
profileApi.get('/profiles/:id/image/view', async (ctx) => {
  const { id } = ctx.req.params

  // Redirect to a signed read-only file URL.
  const photoUrl = await profilesImg
    .file(`images/${id}/photo.png`)
    .getDownloadUrl()
  ctx.res.status = 303
  ctx.res.headers['Location'] = [photoUrl]
})
```

#### Test the extended API

Update all values in brackets `[]` and change the URL to your deployed URL if you're testing on the cloud.

#### Get an image upload URL

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]/image/upload'
```

#### Using the upload URL with curl

```bash
curl --location --request PUT '[url]' \
--header 'content-type: image/png' \
--data-binary '@/home/user/Pictures/photo.png'
```

#### Get an image download URL

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4001/profiles/[id]/image/download'
```
