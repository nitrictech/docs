# Add Cloud Resources to Fastify Apps

In this guide we'll be scaffolding a new Fastify application and including the Nitric framework to allow for the addition of other cloud resources like topics, queues and buckets.

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide you'll need the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed locally
- [Nitric CLI](/getting-started/installation) installed
- _(optional)_ Your choice of an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) account

## Getting Started

Let's start by setting up a Nitric project and adding Fastify:

```bash
nitric new fastify-example js-starter
```

Then install dependencies and add fastify:

```bash
cd fastify-example
yarn install
yarn add fastify
```

You can go ahead and open this new project in your editor of choice. You should see a project structure similar to:

```txt
├── services
│   ├── hello.js
├── node_modules
│   ├── ...
├── .gitignore
├── index.js
├── nitric.yaml
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── yarn.lock
```

In this structure you'll notice the `servuces` folder. By default, this is where Nitric expects the entrypoint code for your application. However, that's just a convention, we can change that to anything else that suits our needs.

Let's start by replacing the default `hello.js` service with an `app.js` file ready for the Fastify application:

```bash
rm ./services/hello.js

touch ./services/app.js
```

Now, let's add some Fastify code to get things started.

```javascript {{ label: 'services/app.js' }}
import Fastify from 'fastify'
import { http } from '@nitric/sdk'

const fastify = Fastify({
  logger: true,
})

fastify.get('/', (request, reply) => {
  reply.send('Hello World!')
})

http(fastify)
```

<Note>
  If you're familiar with Fastify you'll notice this example doesn't call
  `fastify.listen`. The Nitric `http` function takes care of that, as well as
  binding the application to the correct port in each environment.
</Note>

At this point we're ready to start testing locally.

```bash
nitric start
```

Your Fastify application will now be running with Nitric acting as a proxy. We can test this in another terminal or web browser.

```bash {{ label: 'terminal' }}
curl http://localhost:4001
Hello World!
```

## Enhancing Fastify with Nitric

With everything working so far, now is a good time to see how we can add new resources to the Fastify app using Nitric. In this example, let's add a pub/sub topic which allows us to perform work in the background, but still respond quickly via the HTTP API.

You can update the `app.js` file like so:

```javascript {{ label: 'services/app.js' }}
import Fastify from 'fastify'
import { http, topic } from '@nitric/sdk'

const workRequests = topic('work-requests').allow('publish')
const fastify = Fastify({
  logger: true,
})

fastify.get('/', async (request, reply) => {
  await workRequests.publish()
  reply.send('Hello World!')
})

async function bootstrap(port: number) {
  await fastify.listen({ port })

  return fastify.server
}

http(bootstrap, () => {
  console.log(`Application started`)
})
```

We'll also add a new function to do the background work:

```bash
touch services/worker.js
```

Add this code to that file:

```javascript {{ label: 'services/worker.js' }}
import { topic } from '@nitric/sdk'

const sleep = (ms) => new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, ms))

topic('work-requests').subscribe(async (ctx) => {
  console.log('Starting new request')
  // wait for 2 seconds to simulate a long running task
  await sleep(2000)
  console.log('Request processed')
})
```

Now, when you browse to `localhost:4001` you'll notice that the console outputs these lines with a 2 second delay between each line:

```txt
Starting new request
Request processed
```

<Note>
  You should notice that while the background worker takes 2 seconds to finish,
  the HTTP request `GET: /` still returns instantly.
</Note>

At this point, we can stop the running application and try to deploy it to a cloud provider.

## Deploy to the cloud

This is where the true value of Nitric shines. You don't need to perform any manual cloud deployment activities or add solutions like Terraform to get this project into your cloud environment, Nitric takes care of that for you.

To perform the deployment we'll create a `stack`, stacks give Nitric the config needed for a specific cloud instance of this project, such as the provider and region.

The new stack command can help you create the stack by following prompts.

```bash {{ label: 'terminal' }}
nitric stack new
```

This command will create a file named `nitric.dev.yaml`, with contents like this:

```yaml {{ label: 'nitric.dev.yaml' }}
provider: nitric/aws@1.1.0
region: us-east-1
```

With the stack file in place we can run the deployment:

```bash
nitric up
```

Go ahead and test your new Fastify+Nitric app in the cloud, you can start with the API Gateway URL returned by the `up` command.

<Note>
  When you're done with the cloud deployment you can tear it down using the
  `nitric down` command.
</Note>

## What next?

Now that you have the basics down, try exploring other Nitric resources available to enhance your app.
