In this guide we'll show you how to secure your REST API with <a href="https://auth0.com" target="_blank">Auth0</a> and is a continuation of the [REST API Foundations guide](/docs/guides/api/rest-api).

> Middleware is currently only available in Typescript with the [Nitric Node.js SDK](https://github.com/nitrictech/node-sdk)

## What we'll do

1. Setup Auth0 and define our permissions
2. Add the <a href="https://github.com/nitrictech/node-jwt" target="_blank">Node JWT Middleware</a> to our existing stack functions

## Setup Auth0

Building authentication services from scratch is a challenging endeavour which presents a risk if done improperly. Choosing a third-party to provide this functionality is a great option to reduce the risk and minimize the effort required to secure your applications. <a href="https://auth0.com" target="_blank">Auth0</a> is a great option for this, with comprehensive features and free accounts to get things started. Many of the steps in the guide will apply similarly to other services.

Start by creating a <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" target="_blank">free Auth0 account</a> if you don't already have one. Once your account is created, the next thing you'll do is create an <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/getting-started/create-tenant" target="_blank">Auth0 Tenant</a>, which is an isolated container for your auth configuration and users.

Once you have an account and tenant, you'll need to create an API in Auth0. An Auth0 API is an entity representing some resource external to Auth0, in this guide we'll use it to represent your application's API (a collection of Nitric Functions). To create a new Auth0 API, navigate to the APIs page in the Auth0 Dashboard, you can find it under `Applications` > `APIs` in the left nav of the dashboard. From the APIs page click the `Create API` button and follow these steps:

1. Add a **Name** to your API: e.g. `Orders API`
2. Set the API's **Identifier**: e.g. `https://orders-api.example.com`
3. Leave the signing algorithm as `RS256`, this is the best option for security
4. Click the **Create** button

  height="500"
  alt="Service Anatomy"
/>

> **Identifiers** are unique strings that identify your APIs. Auth0 recommends using URLs, however, the URLs won't be called and don't need to be public

Now that the API has been created, you'll need to record some details about the API for use in your Nitric application later. The two values you need are **Audience** and **Domain**, to get these values follow the steps below.

### Get API Audience

1. Click on the **Settings** tab
2. Find the **Identifier** field
3. Copy the identifier value and note it down for later

<img
  src="../../assets/img/auth0-api-identifier.png"
  height="500"
  alt="Service Anatomy"
/>

### Get API Domain

1. Click on the **Test** tab
2. Find the **cURL** example under **Asking Auth0 for tokens from my application**
3. Copy your Auth0 domain and note it down for later

> Note: The **_domain_** is just part of the `--url` parameter, ignore the `https://` protocol prefix and path suffix. E.g. `tenant.region.auth0.com`

<img
  src="../../assets/img/auth0-api-domain.png"
  height="500"
  alt="Service Anatomy"
/>

### Define Permissions

Permissions let you define how resources can be accessed on behalf of the user with a given access token. For example you might choose to grant write access to the `orders` resource if users have administrator level and read access for users with the staff level.

You can define permissions in the **Permissions** tab of the Auth0 Dashboard APIs section.

Lets add `read:orders` and `create:orders` permissions (scopes) to our orders API:

<img
  src="../../assets/img/auth0-api-permissions.png"
  height="500"
  alt="API Permissions"
/>

### Enable RBAC

To ensure that our scopes work and are included in the JWT, RBAC (Role Based Access Control) needs to be enabled.

Go to the API Settings tab:

<img
  src="../../assets/img/auth0-api-settings-tab.png"
  height="150"
  alt="API Settings Tab"
/>

Ensure the following switches are enabled:

<img
  src="../../assets/img/auth0-api-settings-rbac.png"
  height="300"
  alt="API Settings RBAC"
/>

### Add Permissions to Test Application

We will want to test our API, so lets ensure our test application is authorized to access the orders API:

<img
  src="../../assets/img/auth0-api-settings-machine-to-machine.png"
  height="500"
  alt="API Settings Machine to Machine"
/>

## Add Middleware to Functions

You'll now create middleware to run before the handler of your function to protect your handler from unauthenticated or unauthorized requests. When using the `createHandler` function to combine a set of middleware with a handler function, the middleware and handler code will be executed in the order they're specified. When middleware are setup to run _before_ a handler, the middleware functions are able to _protect_ the handler by intercepting unwanted requests and returning a response before the handler is run.

Start by adding these packages to your project:

- <a
    href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nitric/middleware-jwt"
    target="_blank"
  >
    @nitric/middleware-jwt
  </a>
  : provides HTTP middleware which validates JWT tokens in requests, stores decoded
  tokens in the `ctx` object making it easier to work with and validates permissions
  (scopes) from the JWT to perform RBAC Authorization.
- <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwks-rsa" target="_blank">
    jwks-rsa
  </a>
  : provides the ability to retrieve RSA secrets from JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) endpoints.
  In our case, this will retrieve the Auth0 secret used to validate JWT signatures.

Install these libraries with npm.

```bash
npm install @nitric/middleware-jwt jwks-rsa
```

or yarn.

```bash
yarn add @nitric/middleware-jwt jwks-rsa
```

### Validate Access Tokens

Since some elements of the JWT validation process will be specific to your project, instead of providing a JWT validation middleware directly, the `@nitric/middleware-jwt` package provides a higher order function, which returns a customized middleware function. Let's start by creating some common code to call the higher order function and return the JWT middleware specific to your project.

Start by creating an `auth.ts` file under the `common` directory with the following code:

<CodeSnippet snippet="nitrictech/nitric-examples/typescript/rest-api-auth/common/auth.ts" />

Ensure our new auth helper method is exported from `common/index.ts`:

```typescript
export * from './auth';
export * from './order';
export * from './path';
```

### Protect API Functions

Now that we have a common Http Middleware `common/auth.ts` to validate access tokens we can apply it to each of our functions as a handler.

What we'll add to each of our function:

1. Validate the JWT with our common middleware handler.
2. Check the scopes provided by Auth0 with the `jwtScopes` handler, available from the `@nitric/middleware-jwt` package.

#### Create Orders

Add the following code to your `functions/create.ts` file, replacing the **domain** and **audience** options with your own:

<CodeSnippet snippet="nitrictech/nitric-examples/typescript/rest-api-auth/functions/create.ts" />

#### Read Orders

Next, add the following code to your `functions/read.ts` file, again replacing the **domain** and **audience** options with your own:

<CodeSnippet snippet="nitrictech/nitric-examples/typescript/rest-api-auth/functions/read.ts" />

#### List Orders

Our final function to protect is the list function, add the following code to your `functions/list.ts` file, again replacing the **domain** and **audience** options with your own:

<CodeSnippet snippet="nitrictech/nitric-examples/typescript/rest-api-auth/functions/list.ts" />

## Run it!

You can test your API in cURL, Auth0 provides a test token page where you can find a bearer token to test your API endpoints.

Click the copy token button to get the token:

<img
  src="../../assets/img/auth0-get-token.png"
  height="500"
  alt="API Bearer Token"
/>

Let's try it, run your application with the `run` command:

```bash
nitric run
```

First, lets try our **create** orders endpoints without our token. If required swap port 49152 with your port.

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"itemId":"test-item","customerId": "test-customer"}' http://localhost:49152/orders
```

You will notice that we get a 401 Unauthorized response. This means our middleware is working and our API endpoint is protected.

Now test it with your test token, ensure you add the token to the authorization header and if required swap port 49152 with your port:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"itemId":"test-item","customerId": "test-customer"}' http://localhost:49152/orders
```

You will see that we get a successful response. Hooray!

## Deploy to the cloud

Once you're happy that everything is running correctly, you can deploy your API application to a cloud provider of your choice.

<Box
  sx={{
    mb: 2,
    px: 2,
    borderRadius: '4px',
    display: 'grid',
    gap: {
      md: 3,
    },
    gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(3, 1fr)',
    backgroundColor: '#f4f4f4',
    '& > a': {
      display: 'flex',
      flexDirection: 'column',
      justifyContent: 'center',
      px: 1,
      my: {
        xs: 1,
        md: 2,
      },
      transition: 'all 0.3s ease-in',
      '&:hover, &:focus': {
        backgroundColor: '#ececec',
      },
    },
  }}
