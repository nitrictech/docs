In this guide we'll show you how to secure your REST API with <a href="https://auth0.com">Auth0</a> and is a continuation of the [REST API guide](/docs/guides/rest-api).

> Note: Middleware is currently only available in Typescript with the [Nitric Node.js SDK](https://github.com/nitrictech/node-sdk)

## What we'll do

1. Setup Auth0
2. Install the JWT Middleware to our existing API Stack
3. Add the Middleware to our API functions

## Setup Auth0

Building authentication services from scratch is a challenging endeavour which presents a risk if done improperly. Choosing a third-party to provide this functionality is a great option to reduce the risk and minimize the effort required to secure your applications. [Auth0](https://auth0.com) is a great option for this, with comprehensive features and free accounts to get things started. Many of the steps in the guide will apply similarly to other services.

Start by creating a [free Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/signup) if you don't already have one. Once your account is created, the next thing you'll do is create an [Auth0 Tenant](https://auth0.com/docs/getting-started/create-tenant), which is an isolated container for your auth configuration and users.

Once you have an account and tenant, you'll need to create an API in Auth0. An Auth0 API is an entity representing some resource external to Auth0, in this guide we'll use it to represent your application's API (a collection of Nitric Functions). To create a new Auth0 API, navigate to the APIs page in the Auth0 Dashboard, you can find it under `Applications` > `APIs` in the left nav of the dashboard. From the APIs page click the `Create API` button and follow these steps:

1. Add a **Name** to your API: e.g. `Todo API`
2. Set the API's **Identifier**: e.g. `https://todo-api.example.com`
3. Leave the signing algorithm as `RS256`, this is the best option for security
4. Click the **Create** button

> **Identifiers** are unique strings that identify your APIs. Auth0 recommends using URLs, however, the URLs won't be called and don't need to be public

Now that the API has been created, you'll need to record some details about the API for use in your Nitric application later. The two values you need are **Audience** and **Domain**, to get these values follow the steps below.

### Get API Audience

1. Click on the **Settings** tab
2. Find the **Identifier** field
3. Copy the identifier value and note it down for later

### Get API Domain

1. Click on the **Test** tab
2. Find the **cURL** example under **Asking Auth0 for tokens from my application**
3. Copy your Auth0 domain and note it down for later

> Note: The **_domain_** is just part of the `--url` parameter, ignore the `https://` protocol prefix and path suffix. E.g. `tenant.region.auth0.com`

## Add Authentication Middleware to Function(s)

You'll now create middleware to run before the handler of your function to protect your handler from unauthenticated or unauthorized requests. When using the `createHandler` function to combine a set of middleware with a handler function, the middleware and handler code will be executed in the order they're specified. When middleware are setup to run _before_ a handler, the middleware functions are able to _protect_ the handler by intercepting unwanted requests and returning a response before the handler is run.

Start by adding these packages to your project:

- [@nitric/middleware-jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nitric/middleware-jwt): provides HTTP middleware which validates JWT tokens in requests, stores decoded tokens in the `ctx` object making it easier to work with and validates permissions (scopes) from the JWT to perform RBAC Authorization.
- [jwks-rsa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwks-rsa): provides the ability to retrieve RSA secrets from JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) endpoints. In our case, this will retrieve the Auth0 secret used to validate JWT signatures.

```bash
$ yarn add @nitric/middleware-jwt jwks-rsa
```

Since some elements of the JWT validation process will be specific to your project, instead of providing a JWT validation middleware directly, the `@nitric/middleware-jwt` package provides a higher order function, which returns a customized middleware function. Let's start by creating some common code to call the higher order function and return the JWT middleware specific to your project.

```bash
$ touch common/middleware/auth.ts
```

Add the following code to that file:

```typescript
import { jwt, GetSecretOptions } from '@nitric/middleware-jwt';
import * as jwksRsa from 'jwks-rsa';
import supportedAlgos from './config';

const nitricJwtSecret = (options) => {
  if (options === null || options === undefined) {
    // TODO: do something else here.
    throw new Error(
      'An options object must be provided when initializing expressJwtSecret'
    );
  }

  const client = jwksRsa(options);
  // const onError = options.handleSigningKeyError || handleSigningKeyError;

  const secretProvider = async ({ ctx, header, payload }: GetSecretOptions) => {
    if (!header || !supportedAlgos.includes(header.alg)) {
      return null;
    }

    try {
      const key = await client.getSigningKey(header.kid);
      key.getPublicKey();
      return key.getPublicKey();
    } catch (err) {
      throw err;
    }
  };
  return secretProvider;
};

export interface Auth0Config {
  domain: string;
  audience: string;
}

export const checkJwt = ({ domain, audience }: Auth0Config) =>
  jwt({
    secret: nitricJwtSecret({
      cache: true,
      rateLimit: true,
      jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
      jwksUri: `https://${domain}/.well-known/jwks.json`,
    }),
    // Validate the audience and the issuer.
    verifyOptions: {
      audience,
      issuer: `https://${domain}/`,
    },
    algorithms: ['RS256'],
  });
```
