# Building Nitric providers using Pulumi

If you're not already familiar with the basics of Nitric providers, a detailed overview on how Nitric providers work under the hood can be found [here](../custom/building-custom-provider).

Nitric's providers are simple programs that implement a plugin interface backed by gRPC. A Nitric provider is a simple server that will be started by the Nitric CLI at deploy time and will be provided with a cloud specification to deploy any way the provider sees fit.

Although Nitric providers can be developed using any language, we'd recommend using Go due to the availability of pre-existing Nitric Pulumi custom resources and generated protobuf contracts in the Nitric core repository.

This code provides a simple gRPC deployment server with references to the Pulumi Automation API. It can be used to get started with deploying infrastructure through Pulumi.

```go
type DeployServer struct {
}

func (d *DeployServer) Up(request *deploy.DeployUpRequest, stream deploy.DeployService_UpServer) error {
    // Nitric provides details such as stack and project name on the request, but you're free to change these up to suit your needs
    pulumiStack, err := auto.UpsertStackInlineSource(context.TODO(), "<your_stack_name>", "<you_stack_project>", func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {
        // ðŸ‘‡ Your pulumi program goes here...
        for _, res := range request.Spec.Resources {
            // Requested resources are provided as part of the deployment request
        }
    })

    if err != nil {
      return err
    }

    res, err := pulumiStack.Up(context.TODO(), optup.ProgressStreams(messageWriter))
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // send final results
    // err = stream.Send(...)

    return err
}

func (d *DeployServer) Down(request *deploy.DeployDownRequest, stream deploy.DeployService_DownServer) error {
    // Nitric provides details such as stack and project name on the request, but you're free to change these up to suit your needs
    s, err := auto.UpsertStackInlineSource(context.TODO(), "<your_stack_name>", "<your_project_name>", nil)
  if err != nil {
    return status.Errorf(codes.Internal, err.Error())
  }

  // destroy the stack
  _, err = s.Destroy(context.TODO(), optdestroy.ProgressStreams(dsMessageWriter))
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
}
```

Let us know on our GitHub discussions or through our Discord if you are interested in seeing more work in this space, including the creation of [CDKs](/reference/providers/custom/building-custom-provider#future-features) that can simplify the process of scaffolding and building Nitric providers.
