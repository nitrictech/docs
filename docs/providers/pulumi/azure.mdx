# Azure Provider Overview

_The officially supported Nitric Azure Provider._

```yaml
provider: nitric/azure@latest
```

<Note>
  See the [Overview](/providers/pulumi) page for general information on Nitric
  Pulumi providers.
</Note>

<Note>
  Nitric runs services (APIs, Schedules and Topic Subscribers) on Azure
  Container Apps, which is unavailable in a [small number of
  regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=container-apps&regions=all).
</Note>

The Azure provider is supported by the Nitric SDKs and CLI by default. However, credentials for an Azure account will be required when using the [up command](/reference/cli) from the CLI.

## Azure Credentials

The Nitric CLI uses the standard Azure credentials to authenticate with Azure. If you've set up local credentials for the Azure CLI or an SDK previously, these settings should work without modification.

If you're setting up your credentials for the first time, simply run azure login command and finish the login via your browser.

```bash
az login
```

Verify the Azure CLI install -

```bash
az -v
```

<Note>
  See [Azure
  documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli)
  for full details on credentials and configuration.
</Note>

### Azure CLI Installation

Installing the Azure CLI assists with credentials setup. You can install it using these summarized instructions, for more options see the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Locating deployed resources

This Nitric Azure provider deploys resources for a stack into a resource group dedicated to that stack. You can either use one your already have by configuring it in the stack configuration or let Nitric create one for you.

Once a stack has been deployed to Azure it's resource group should be present in the [Resource groups](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroupBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Resources%2Fsubscriptions%2FresourceGroups) page of the portal. Assuming it was deployed to a subscription you have access to.

<Note>
  Resource groups are conventionally named `<project-name>-<stack-name>-<randomId>`

In this example the project name is `api-testing` and the stack name is `az`.

</Note>

![resource group page screen](/docs/images/docs/az-rg.png)

More recent versions of the Nitric Azure provider display a direct link to the resource group in output from `nitric up`.

Example:

```bash
Resource Group:
──────────────
https://portal.azure.com/#@your-tenant-id/resource/subscriptions/your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/your-resource-group/overview

API Endpoints:
──────────────
main: https://example-api865cb.azure-api.net
```

# All configuration below is optional

# Apply configuration to nitric APIs
