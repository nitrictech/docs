# AWS Provider Overview

_The officially supported Nitric AWS Provider._

```yaml
provider: nitric/aws@latest
```

<Note>
  See the [Overview](/providers/pulumi) page for general information on Nitric
  Pulumi providers.
</Note>

The AWS provider is supported by the Nitric SDKs and CLI by default. However, credentials for an AWS account will be required when using the [up command](/reference/cli) from the CLI.

## AWS Credentials

The Nitric CLI uses standard AWS credential settings to authenticate with AWS. If you've set credentials for the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK previously, these settings should work without modification.

If you're setting your credentials for the first time, there are several available methods. We recommend the standard AWS credentials file to get started.

### AWS Credential File Setup

Create a new credentials files at one of these locations:

- `~/.aws/credentials` on Linux, macOS, or Unix
- `C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials` on Windows

The file should contain the following:

```toml
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your_access_key_id
aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_access_key
```

<Note>
  To use a different AWS profile for your deployments, you can use the
  `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable. If no profile is supplied, we will use the
  `[default]` profile.
</Note>

Replace `your_access_key_id` and `your_secret_access_key` with your own values.

You can create an Access Key by logging into the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and navigating to:
`Username Menu > Security credentials > Access keys > Create New Access Key`

<Note>
  See [AWS
  documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html)
  for full details on credentials and configuration.
</Note>

## Locating deployed resources

This Nitric AWS provider creates a resource tag manager group and tags all possible resources to be referenced by this group. You can locate resources using the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).

Start by navigating to the [Resource Groups service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/resource-groups/home):

![resource group search image](/docs/images/docs/aws-rg.png)

Find your stack's resource group in the list and click it:

<Note>
  Resource groups are conventionally named `<project-name>-<stack-name>`

In this example the project name is `api-testing` and the stack name is `aws`.

</Note>

![resource group list image](/docs/images/docs/aws-rg-screen.png)

More recent versions of the Nitric AWS provider also display a direct link to the resource group in output from `nitric up`.

Example:

```bash
Deployed Resources:
──────────────
https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/resource-groups/group/arn%3Aaws%3Aresource-groups%3Aus-east-2%3A3123456789%3Agroup%2Fexample-aws

API Endpoints:
──────────────
main: https://example.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
```

# Import existing AWS Resources
# Currently only secrets are supported
# Available since v0.28.0
import:
  # A name ARN map of buckets, where the name matches the nitric name of the bucket you would like to import
  buckets: # Available since v1.10.0
    # NOTE: Imported S3 buckets must exist in the same AWS account and region as the Nitric project
    my-bucket: arn:...
  # A name ARN map of secrets, where the name matches the nitric name of the secret you would like to import
  secrets: # Available since v0.28.0
    # In typescript this would import the provided secret reference for a secret declared as
