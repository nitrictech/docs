# AWS Provider Overview

_The officially supported Nitric AWS Provider._

```yaml
provider: nitric/aws@latest
```

The AWS provider is supported by the Nitric SDKs and CLI by default. However, credentials for an AWS account will be required when using the [up command](/reference/cli) from the CLI.

## AWS Credentials

The Nitric CLI uses standard AWS credential settings to authenticate with AWS. If you've set credentials for the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK previously, these settings should work without modification.

If you're setting your credentials for the first time, there are several available methods. We recommend the standard AWS credentials file to get started.

### AWS Credential File Setup

Create a new credentials files at one of these locations:

- `~/.aws/credentials` on Linux, macOS, or Unix
- `C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials` on Windows

The file should contain the following:

```toml
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your_access_key_id
aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_access_key
```

<Note>
  To use a different AWS profile for your deployments, you can use the
  `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable. If no profile is supplied, we will use the
  `[default]` profile.
</Note>

Replace `your_access_key_id` and `your_secret_access_key` with your own values.

You can create an Access Key by logging into the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and navigating to:
`Username Menu > Security credentials > Access keys > Create New Access Key`

<Note>
  See [AWS
  documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html)
  for full details on credentials and configuration.

## Configuration

```yaml title:nitric.[stack ID].yaml
# The provider to use and it's published version
# See releases:
# https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/tags
provider: nitric/aws@latest

# The target aws region to deploy to
# See available regions:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lambda-service.html
region: my-aws-stack-region

# The timezone that deployed schedules will run with
# Format is in tz identifiers:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
schedule-timezone: Australia/Sydney # Available since v0.27.0

# Import existing AWS Resources
# Currently only secrets are supported
# Available since v0.28.0
import:
  # A name ARN map of buckets, where the name matches the nitric name of the bucket you would like to import
  buckets: # Available since v1.10.0
    # NOTE: Imported S3 buckets must exist in the same AWS account and region as the Nitric project
    my-bucket: arn:...
  # A name ARN map of secrets, where the name matches the nitric name of the secret you would like to import
  secrets: # Available since v0.28.0
    # In typescript this would import the provided secret reference for a secret declared as
    # const mySecret = secret('my-secret');
    my-secret: arn:...

# Apply configuration to nitric APIs
apis:
  # The nitric name of the API to configure
  my-api:
    # Array of domains to apply to the API
    # The domain or parent domain must have a hosted zone already in Route53
    domains:
      - api.example.com

# Configure your deployed services
config:
  # How services without a type will be deployed
  default:
    # configure a sample rate for telemetry (between 0 and 1) e.g. 0.5 is 50%
    telemetry: 0
    # configure services to deploy to AWS lambda
    lambda: # Available since v0.26.0
      # set 128MB of RAM
      # See lambda configuration docs here:
      # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-function-common.html#configuration-memory-console
      memory: 128
      # set a timeout of 15 seconds
      # See lambda timeout values here:
      # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-function-common.html#configuration-timeout-console
      timeout: 15
      # set a provisioned concurrency value
      # For info on provisioned concurrency for AWS Lambda see:
      # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html
      provisioned-concurrency: 0
      # Configure VPCs that the lambda can access
      vpc:
        # Array of existing security group ids to apply
        security-group-ids:
          - sg-xxx
        # Array of existing subnet ids to apply
        subnet-ids:
          - subnet-xxx
  # Additional deployment types
  # You can target these types by setting a `type` in your project configuration
  big-service:
    telemetry: 0
    lambda:
      memory: 1024
      timeout: 60
