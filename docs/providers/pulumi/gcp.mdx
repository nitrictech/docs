# Google Cloud Provider Overview

_The officially supported Nitric Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Provider._

```yaml
provider: nitric/gcp@latest
```

<Note>
  See the [Overview](/providers/pulumi) page for general information on Nitric
  Pulumi providers.
</Note>

The Google Cloud provider is supported by the Nitric SDKs and CLI by default. However, credentials for a Google Cloud account will be required when using the [up command](/reference/cli) from the CLI.

## Google Cloud Credentials

Authorize `gcloud` to access the Cloud Platform with Google user credentials:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### Google CLI Installation

Installing the Google Cloud CLI assists with credentials setup. You can install it using these summarized instructions, for more options see the [Google docs](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install).

## Create Billing Account

For Google Cloud to allow deployments, a billing account must be [created and attached](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) to the project you deploy to.

## Stack Configuration

```yaml title:nitric.[stack ID].yaml
# The provider to use and it's published version
# See releases:
# https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/tags
provider: nitric/gcp@latest

# The target GCP region to deploy to
# See available regions:
# https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/locations
region: my-gcp-stack-region

# ID of the google cloud project to deploy into
gcp-project-id: my-gcp-project-id

# All configuration below is optional

# The timezone that deployed schedules will run with
# Format is in tz identifiers:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
schedule-timezone: Australia/Sydney

# Import existing GCP Resources
# Currently only secrets are supported
# Available since v1.4.0
import:
  # A map of nitric names to GCP Secret Manager names
  secrets: # Available since v1.4.0
    # NOTE: Imported secrets must exist in the same project as specified by gcp-project-id
    # In typescript this would import the provided secret reference for a secret declared as
    # const mySecret = secret('my-secret');
    my-secret: existing-secret

# Apply configuration to nitric APIs
apis:
  # Target an API by its nitric name
  my-api:
    # provide domains to be used for the api

# Configure your deployed services
config:
  # How services without a type will be deployed
  default:
    # configure services to deploy to Google Cloud Run
    cloudrun:
      # set 512MB of RAM
      # See cloudrun configuration docs here:
      # https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/memory-limits
      memory: 512
      # set a timeout of 15 seconds
      # https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/request-timeout
      timeout: 15
      # The maximum number of instances to scale down to
      # https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/min-instances
      min-instances: 0
      # The maximum number of instances to scale up to
      # https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/max-instances
      max-instances: 10
      # Number of concurrent requests that each instance can handle
      # https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/concurrency
      concurrency: 80
  # Additional deployment types
  # You can target these types by setting a `type` in your project configuration
  big-service:
    cloudrun:
      memory: 1024
      timeout: 60
      min-instances: 2
      max-instances: 100
