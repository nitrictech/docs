# Terraform AWS Provider Overview

_The officially supported Nitric Terraform AWS Provider._

```yaml
provider: nitric/awstf@latest
```

<Note>
  The Nitric Terraform AWS Provider is currently in preview, it's not
  recommended for production deployments. We recommend using the [Pulumi AWS
  Providers](/providers/pulumi/aws) for production deployments until the
  Terraform provider is stable.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

The **Terraform CLI** is required to deploy the resulting Terraform Stack that Nitric generates. You can find the installation instructions for Terraform in the [Terraform documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

The provider is built with the [Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF)](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf). Since CDKTF relies on Node.js, you'll need to have Node.js installed, you can read about the full CDKTF prerequisites in the [CDKTF documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cdktf/cdktf-install#prerequisites).

## Enabling Nitric Terraform Providers

The Nitric Terraform providers are currently in preview, to enable them you'll need to enable `beta-providers` in your Nitric project. You can do this by adding the following to your project's `nitric.yaml` file:

```yaml title:nitric.yaml
preview:
  - beta-providers
```

## AWS Credentials

The Terraform CLI typically uses standard AWS credential settings to authenticate with AWS. If you've set credentials for the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK previously, these settings should work without modification.

If you're setting your credentials for the first time, there are several available methods. We recommend the standard AWS credentials file to get started.

### AWS Credential File Setup

Create a new credentials files at one of these locations:

- `~/.aws/credentials` on Linux, macOS, or Unix
- `C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials` on Windows

The file should contain the following:

```toml
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your_access_key_id
aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_access_key
```

<Note>
  To use a different AWS profile for your deployments, you can use the
  `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable. If no profile is supplied, we will use the
  `[default]` profile.
</Note>

Replace `your_access_key_id` and `your_secret_access_key` with your own values.

You can create an Access Key by logging into the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and navigating to:
`Username Menu > Security credentials > Access keys > Create New Access Key`

<Note>
  See [AWS
  documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html)
  for full details on credentials and configuration.

## Stack Configuration

```yaml title:nitric.[stack ID].yaml
# The provider to use and it's published version
# See releases:
# https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/tags
provider: nitric/awstf@latest

# The target aws region to deploy to
# See available regions:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lambda-service.html
region: my-aws-stack-region

# Optional outdir
# outdir: ./tf-output

# config:
# Config (same as base AWS provider except for VPC/Secret imports)

# The timezone that deployed schedules will run with
# Format is in tz identifiers:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
schedule-timezone: Australia/Sydney # Available since v0.27.0

# Apply configuration to nitric APIs
apis:
  # The nitric name of the API to configure
  my-api:
    # Array of domains to apply to the API
    # The domain or parent domain must have a hosted zone already in Route53
    domains:
      - api.example.com

# Configure your deployed services
config:
  # How services without a type will be deployed
  default:
    # configure a sample rate for telemetry (between 0 and 1) e.g. 0.5 is 50%
    telemetry: 0
    # configure services to deploy to AWS lambda
    lambda: # Available since v0.26.0
      # set the memory in MB
      # See lambda configuration docs here:
      # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-function-common.html#configuration-memory-console
      memory: 128
      # set a timeout in seconds
      # See lambda timeout values here:
      # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-function-common.html#configuration-timeout-console
      timeout: 15
      # set the amount of ephemeral-storage in MB
      # For info on ephemeral-storage for AWS Lambda see:
      # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-ephemeral-storage.html
      ephemeral-storage: 512
  # Additional deployment types
  # You can target these types by setting a `type` in your project configuration
