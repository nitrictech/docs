# Nitric Terraform Providers

Nitric enables application portability and deployments through pluggable modules known as [providers](/get-started/foundations/deployment#providers). This allows applications to be deployed with many different Infrastructure Automation technologies, including [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Nitric has pre-built providers that use Terraform to deploy to [AWS](/providers/terraform/aws) and [Google Cloud](/providers/terraform/gcp), with Azure support planned.

<Note>
  All pre-built Terraform providers are [IaC generating
  providers](/get-started/foundations/deployment#providers).
</Note>

## Prerequisites

The **Terraform CLI** is required to deploy the resulting Terraform Stack that Nitric generates. You can find the installation instructions for Terraform in the [Terraform documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

The provider is built with the [Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF)](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf). Since CDKTF relies on **Node.js**, you'll need to have Node.js installed, you can read about the full CDKTF prerequisites in the [CDKTF documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cdktf/cdktf-install#prerequisites).

<Note>
  Terraform providers are currently in preview, they're not recommended for
  production deployments. We recommend using the [Pulumi
  Provider](/providers/pulumi) for production deployments until the Terraform
  providers are stable.
</Note>

## Enabling Nitric Terraform Providers

The Nitric Terraform providers are currently in preview, to enable them you'll need to enable `beta-providers` in your Nitric project. You can do this by adding the following to your project's `nitric.yaml` file:

```yaml title:nitric.yaml
preview:
  - beta-providers
```

## Available Terraform Providers

- [AWS](/providers/terraform/aws)
- [Google Cloud](/providers/terraform/gcp)
- Azure (Coming Soon)

## How Nitric integrates with Terraform

Nitric uses the [Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF)](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf) to generate Terraform code for your application. This code can be deployed using the standard Terraform CLI commands.

When you run `nitric up` in your project directory, Nitric will generate the Terraform code for your application, outputting the result to a directory named `cdktf.out` by default. You can then navigate into this directory and use the standard Terraform commands to deploy your application.

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Getting Started

To get started with the Nitric Terraform provider, you'll need to install the Nitric CLI and the Terraform CLI. You can find the installation instructions for both in the [Nitric CLI](/reference/cli) and [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) documentation.

Once you have the Nitric CLI and Terraform CLI installed, you can create a new Nitric project as usual, if you're new to Nitric, check out the [Getting Started](/get-started/quickstart) guide.

To use the Nitric Terraform provider, you'll need to create a new Nitric stack that uses the Terraform provider. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
nitric stack new
```

This will create a new Nitric stack and prompt you to select a provider. Select the Terraform provider of your choice during this process.

Once you've created your Nitric stack, you can generate the Terraform code by running the following command:

```bash
nitric up
```

<Note>
  If you project has more than one stack you'll be prompted to select the stack
  you want to deploy. Choose the stack that uses the Terraform provider to
  generate the Terraform code.
</Note>

This will generate the Terraform code for your Nitric application into a folder named `cdktf.out` by default. You can change this via the `outdir` property and inspect the code before deploying.

To deploy the application using Terraform, you can navigate into your Terraform stack directory and use the standard Terraform commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
