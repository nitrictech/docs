# Terraform Azure Provider Overview

_The officially supported Nitric Terraform Azure Provider._

```yaml
provider: nitric/azuretf@latest
```

<Note>
  The Nitric Terraform Azure Provider is currently in preview, it's not
  recommended for production deployments. We recommend using the [Pulumi Azure
  Providers](/providers/pulumi/azure) for production deployments until the
  Terraform provider is stable.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

The **Terraform CLI** is required to deploy the resulting Terraform Stack that Nitric generates. You can find the installation instructions for Terraform in the [Terraform documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).

The provider is built with the [Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF)](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf). Since CDKTF relies on Node.js, you'll need to have Node.js installed, you can read about the full CDKTF prerequisites in the [CDKTF documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cdktf/cdktf-install#prerequisites).

## Enabling Nitric Terraform Providers

The Nitric Terraform providers are currently in preview, to enable them you'll need to enable `beta-providers` in your Nitric project. You can do this by adding the following to your project's `nitric.yaml` file:

```yaml title:nitric.yaml
preview:
  - beta-providers
```

## Azure Credentials

The Terraform CLI typically uses standard Azure credential settings to authenticate with Azure. If you've set credentials for the Azure CLI or an Azure SDK previously, these settings should work without modification.

If you're setting up your credentials for the first time, simply run azure login command and finish the login via your browser.

```bash
az login
```

Verify the Azure CLI install -

```bash
az -v
```

<Note>
  See [Azure
  documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli)
  for full details on credentials and configuration.

### Azure CLI Installation

Installing the Azure CLI assists with credentials setup. You can install it using these summarized instructions, for more options see the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Locating deployed resources

This Nitric Azure provider deploys resources for a stack into a resource group dedicated to that stack. You can either use one your already have by configuring it in the stack configuration or let Nitric create one for you.

Once a stack has been deployed to Azure it's resource group should be present in the [Resource groups](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroupBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Resources%2Fsubscriptions%2FresourceGroups) page of the portal. Assuming it was deployed to a subscription you have access to.

<Note>
  Resource groups are conventionally named `<project-name>-<stack-name>-<randomId>`

In this example the project name is `api-testing` and the stack name is `az`.
