# Terraform GCP Provider Overview

The officially supported Nitric Terraform GCP Provider.

<Note>
  The Nitric Terraform GCP Provider is currently in preview, it's not
  recommended for production deployments. We recommend using the [Standard
  Providers](/reference/providers) for production deployments until the
  Terraform providers are stable.
</Note>

## Usage

The Terraform GCP provider is supported by the Nitric SDKs and CLI by default. However, the Terraform CLI or equivalent will be required to deploy the resulting Terraform Stack that Nitric generates.

### GCP Credentials

The Terraform CLI typically uses standard GCP credential settings to authenticate with GCP. If you've used the GCP CLI to login or another standard method previously, these settings should work without modification.

If you're setting your credentials for the first time we recommend the using the gcloud CLI auth command.

### Google Cloud Credentials

Authorize `gcloud` to access the Cloud Platform with Google user credentials:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

## Configuration

See the original [GCP Configuration](/reference/providers/gcp/configuration) guide and select the Terraform tab for more information on configuring your GCP stacks with Terraform.
