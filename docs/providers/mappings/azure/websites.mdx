# Azure Resources - Websites

Nitric Websites are deployed to Azure using [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) and [Azure Front Door](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/frontdoor/).

## Azure Resources

The following resources are created when deploying Websites to Azure:

- Blob Storage Account with Static Website
- Front Door Endpoint (with Front Door Classic)
- Delivery Rules for API rewrites

## Deployment

During deployment the Nitric CLI creates a storage account for your website assets and a Front Door distribution to serve them:

- The declared website is created in Blob Storage
- A Front Door endpoint is created to serve your website and rewrite all APIs to `/api/{apiName}` using Delivery Rules
- Cache invalidation is automatic based on changed files
