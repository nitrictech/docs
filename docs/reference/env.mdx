# Environment Variables

Nitric sets a number of environment variables to help you manage your project. These variables are available in the cloud, build, and run environments.

## System Environment Variables

If you are running your project in the cloud, build, or the run environment, Nitric provides prefixed Environment Variables, which you can find in the table below.

| Name               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| NITRIC_STACK_ID    | The Stack ID of the project. Example: `coolkat-gcp-4c0wg0hg`                                                                                                                                                                  |
| NITRIC_ENVIRONMENT | The Environment that the app is running on. The value can be either `cloud` (for deployed in the cloud), `run` (for stacks running in nitric run), or `build` (for stack code running during the deployment gathering phase). |
