# .NET - Api.Route()

<Note>
  This is reference documentation for the Nitric .NET SDK. To learn about APIs
  in Nitric start with the [API docs](/api).
</Note>

Creates a new route (path) within an API.

```csharp
using Application = Nitric.Sdk.Nitric;

var route = Application.Api("main").Route("/customers");

Application.Run();
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  <Property name="match" type="string" required>
    The path matcher to use for this route. Calling `route` on the same API more
    than once with the same matcher will return the same route object. Matchers
    accept path parameters in the form of a colon prefixed string. The string
    provided will be used as that path parameter's name when calling middleware
    and handlers. See [create a route with path
    params](#create-a-route-with-path-params)
  </Property>
  <Property name="options" type="object">
    Additional options when creating the route.
    <Properties nested>
      <Property name="middleware" type="HttpMiddleware or HttpMiddleware[]">
        Middleware to apply to all methods on this route.
      </Property>
    </Properties>
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Notes

The `middleware` property on the `options` param is useful for applying universal middleware such as CORS headers or Auth, across an entire route. However, if methods aren't registered, the route won't be deployed. If you need to run the same handler for all methods on a route, you should use [route.all()](./api-route-all)

## Examples

### Create a route

```csharp
using Application = Nitric.Sdk.Nitric;

var route = Application.Api("main").Route("/customers");

Application.Run();
```

### Create a route with path params

Route paths can include dynamic parameters. These values will automatically be parsed and provided in the context object for your middleware and handlers as a `string`.

For example, if you have a customers path and you want to include a `customerId` param you would define the route like this.

```csharp
using Application = Nitric.Sdk.Application;

var route = Application.Api("main").Route("/customers/:customerId");

Application.Run();
```

### Create a route with middleware

```csharp
using Nitric.Sdk.Service;
using Nitric.Sdk.Resource;
using Application = Nitric.Sdk.Nitric;

var main = Application.Api("main");

var route = main.Route("/customers", new RouteOptions(middleware: new Middleware<HttpContext>[] {
  (context, next) =>
  {
    var user = context.Req.PathParams["userId"];

    // Validate the user identity
    if (user != "1234")
    {
      context.Res.Text($"User {user} is unauthorised");
      context.Res.Status = 403;

      // Return prematurely to end the middleware chain.
      return context;
    }

    // Call next to continue the middleware chain.
    return next(context);
  }
}));

Application.Run();
```
