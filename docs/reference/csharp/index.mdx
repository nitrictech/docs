# Nitric\'s .NET SDK

This SDK reference provides documentation for the functions and methods in Nitric\'s .NET library.

The library provides the ability to define and interact with cloud resources, as well as build application logic like functions/handlers.

## Installation

If you used a Nitric starter template for .NET to scaffold your project, then the `Nitric.Sdk` package will already be included in the dependencies in your `.csproj` file. Using starter templates is the recommended installation option since it ensures the other files and configuration needed are also set up.

However, you can also install the SDK.

```bash
dotnet add package Nitric.Sdk
```

## Custom runtime

To successfully run and deploy .NET applications using the Nitric framework, it is necessary to use a custom runtime Dockerfile. This Dockerfile ensures that your .NET application is built and executed within an appropriate environment, taking into account all dependencies and configurations required by Nitric.

### Default Dockerfile

For your convenience, Nitric provides a default Dockerfile specifically tailored for .NET applications. This default Dockerfile is included with the [.NET starter template](https://github.com/nitrictech/examples/tree/main/v1/csharp-starter) available through the Nitric CLI. By using this template, you can quickly set up your development environment and focus on building your application without worrying about Docker configuration.

This Dockerfile provides a solid starting point for deploying .NET applications with Nitric. Feel free to customize it according to your application's needs.
