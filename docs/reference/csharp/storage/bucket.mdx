# .NET - Bucket()

Create a new bucket for storing and retrieving files.

```csharp
using Nitric.Sdk.Resource;
using Application = Nitric.Sdk.Nitric;

var assets = Application.Bucket("assets").Allow(BucketPermission.Read, BucketPermission.Write, BucketPermission.Delete);

Application.Run();
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  <Property name="name" type="string" required>
    The unique name of this bucket within the app. Subsequent calls to `Bucket`
    with the same name will return the same object.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Access

All Nitric resources provide access permissions you can use to specify the level of access your code needs to the resource. See here for details about infrastructure [security](/get-started/foundations/infrastructure/security).

### Available permissions:

---

**BucketPermission.Read**

This permission allows your function to read files from the bucket

---

**BucketPermission.Write**

This permission allows your function to write files to the bucket

---

**BucketPermission.Delete**

This permission allows your function to delete files from the bucket

---

## Working with files

See the following for examples on working with files in a bucket:

- [File()](./bucket-file)
- [File().Read()](./bucket-file-read)
- [File().Write()](./bucket-file-write)
- [File().Delete()](./bucket-file-delete)
- [File.GetDownloadUrl()](./bucket-file-downloadurl)
- [File.GetUploadUrl()](./bucket-file-uploadurl)
