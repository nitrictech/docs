Nitric Topics are deployed to Azure using [Azure Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-grid/).

## Azure Resources

The following resources are created when deploying Topics to Azure:

- Event Grid Topic
- Event Grid Subscriptions
- Azure Resource Group

## Deployment

During deployment Nitric's CLI builds your Topics will be built as follows:

- The Topic definitions as Event Grid Topics
- Subscriber functions are built into container images
- Container images are pushed to [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/) as private images
- Container Apps are setup to run the containers
- Container Apps are subscribed to defined Topics in Event Grid
