## Complete Example with comments

<CodeSwitcher>

```yaml {{ title: "Pulumi" }}
# The provider to use and it's published version
# See releases:
# https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/tags
provider: nitric/aws@1.12.4

# The target aws region to deploy to
# See available regions:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lambda-service.html
region: my-aws-stack-region

# The timezone that deployed schedules will run with
# Format is in tz identifiers:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
schedule-timezone: Australia/Sydney # Available since v0.27.0

# Import existing AWS Resources
# Currently only secrets are supported
# Available since v0.28.0
import:
  # A name ARN map of buckets, where the name matches the nitric name of the bucket you would like to import
  buckets: # Available since v1.10.0
    # NOTE: Imported S3 buckets must exist in the same AWS account and region as the Nitric project
    my-bucket: arn:...
  # A name ARN map of secrets, where the name matches the nitric name of the secret you would like to import
  secrets: # Available since v0.28.0
    # In typescript this would import the provided secret reference for a secret declared as
    # const mySecret = secret('my-secret');

# Apply configuration to nitric APIs
apis:
  # The nitric name of the API to configure
  my-api:
    # Array of domains to apply to the API
    # The domain or parent domain must have a hosted zone already in Route53
    domains:
