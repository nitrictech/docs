A Nitric collection is described by its definition in a `nitric.yaml` file. A collection represents a container for the storage of documents.

## Properties

> Collections do not have properties at present and are represented only by their name at this time.

## Example

```yaml
name: example-stack

buckets:
  example-collection: {}
```

#### Limitations

Please note on AWS the DynamoDB database has a maximum document size of a 400 KB. If you expect documents larger than this
we recommend you:

- decompose any large nested structures into document subcollections
- store very large document fields in the Storage Service and keep a storage service `bucket/key` reference in your document

See the [Documents API](../api/documents) reference for examples of interacting with defined documents.
