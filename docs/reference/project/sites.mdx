Static sites are a great way to use your favorite frameworks to host the front-end of your nitric application, and is generally a faster and cheaper way to host front-end content when compared to rendering your application through a server.

Nitric supports this capability by allowing you to configure your site into a nitric stack for automatic building and upload during deployments.

Sites can be wired up to the rest of your stack by using [entrypoints](./entrypoints.mdx), allowing you to easily access other services directly from your site under a single origin.

> Support for static sites is currently limited to a few providers, to see if a provider is compatible see the table [here](../../intro/concepts/nitric-apis.mdx)

## Example Site

```yaml
name: example-stack
sites:
  example-site:
    path: example-site
    assetPath: ./static
    buildScripts:
      - npm run build
```

## Properties

| **Property** | **Value** | **Description**                                                         |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| path         | string    | Path of the static site project relative to root of your nitric project |
| assetPath    | string    | Location of static site assets once site is built relative to path      |
| buildScripts | string[]  | Scripts to run in order to build static site assets                     |

## Connecting your site to your stack

To host and wire up your site to the rest of your stack you will need to use [entrypoints](./entrypoints.mdx)

```yaml
name: example-site

functions:
  example-function:
    handler: functions/example.ts

sites:
  example-site:
    path: example-site
    assetPath: ./static
    buildScripts:
      - npm run build

entrypoints:
  main:
    paths:
      /:
        type: site
        target: example-site
      /example/:
        type: function
        target: example-service
```

In the above example your site would now be able to call the example-function, by simply making a request to `/example/`, as these two resources will be served under a single origin together.
