Nitric applications are supported on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by default. You can automatically deploy an existing application to Google Cloud using the [Nitric CLI](/docs/reference/cli), with the GCP plugin.

## Installing the CLI plugin

To install the official Nitric GCP Plugin, running the following command:

```bash
nitric plugins:install @nitric/plugin-gcp
```

This will download and install Google Cloud specific commands for the cli.

## Checking Prerequisites

Next, you can check that any prerequisite software is also installed by using the doctor sub-command for GCP:

```bash
nitric doctor:gcp
```

## Setup Credentials

For simplicity, we recommend installing the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) when developing. You can then [authorize access with a user account](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#authorizing_with_a_user_account).

A summary of the required steps include:

- Download the Google Cloud SDK and add it to your PATH
- Run `gcloud init` to initialize the SDK
- Finally, obtain [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default) with `gcloud auth application-default login`

## Deploy

When you're ready to deploy your application to Google Cloud, you can use the GCP CLI Plugin to automate the deployment process. Use the `deploy:gcp` command from the root of your project to start an interactive deployment process:

```bash
nitric deploy:gcp
```

For automated build processes you can provide the prompt options on the command line.

When deploying for the first time to a project, you will want to make sure that the [required APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/) are enabled on GCP. Without doing so, the first deployment will result in an error.

To update an existing deployment, simply re-run the command.

## Undeploy

To pull down a previously deployed application from Google Cloud, run the down command from the root of your project.

```bash
nitric down:gcp
```
