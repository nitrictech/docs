> **Partial Support:** Nitric currently supports DigitalOcean for [Services](./services) and [Entrypoints](./entrypoints) only.

Nitric applications are supported on DigitalOcean, however many features are currently unavailable or under development. You can automatically deploy an existing application to DigitalOcean using the [Nitric CLI](/docs/reference/cli), with the DigitalOcean plugin.

## Installing the CLI plugin

To install the official Nitric DigitalOcean Plugin, running the following command:

```bash
nitric plugins:install @nitric/plugin-do
```

This will download and install DigitalOcean specific commands for the cli.

## Checking Prerequisites

Next, you can check that any prerequisite software is also installed by using the doctor sub-command for DigitalOcean:

```bash
nitric doctor:do
```

## Setup Credentials

The Nitric DigitalOcean CLI Plugin requires a Personal Access Token to authenticate with the DigitalOcean API. This can be provided via an environment variable, like so:

```bash
export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with your own token value. You can create a Personal Access Token by logging into the <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean Console</a> and navigating to `API (under 'ACCOUNT')` > `Tokens/Keys` > `Personal Access Tokens` > `Generate New Token`.

## Deploy

When you're ready to deploy your application to DigitalOcean, you can use the DigitalOcean CLI Plugin to automate the deployment process. Use the `deploy:do` command from the root of your project to start an interactive deployment process:

```bash
nitric deploy:do
```

For automated build processes you can provide the prompt options on the command line.

To update an existing deployment, simply re-run the command.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** A DigitalOcean "App" will be deployed for _each_ entrypoint in your Nitric application.

Due to lack of component sharing between DigitalOcean App Platform Apps, duplicate containers will be created for each Nitric Service shared between entrypoints. As a result, you will be charged for each instance of the container, one for each entrypoint targeting that container. We recommend limiting the number of entrypoints in your application or having each entrypoint target a unique set of services.

## Undeploy

To pull down a previously deployed application from DigitalOcean, run the down command from the root of your project.

```bash
nitric down:do
```

## Current Status

See [Nitric API](../concepts/nitric-apis) for the current support status of each Nitric Service, when deployed to DigitalOcean.
