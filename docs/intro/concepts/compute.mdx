Nitric provides cloud portable compute with:

- [Functions](/docs/reference/project/functions)
- [Containers](/docs/reference/project/containers)

## Functions

Functions provide lightweight and portable Lambda code.

Functions use the Nitric FaaS [Middleware](./middleware) framework and [APIs](/docs/reference/api) to provide a great developer experience and ensure cloud portability.

Nitric automatically builds your functions into OCI compliant Docker containers and can run them locally for development or deploy them to leading Container-as-a-Service offerings such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run and DigitalOcean App Platform.

Nitric containers are packaged with the Nitric Membrane which provides a cloud integrating gateway and service proxy. This ensures your code to remain cloud portable.

## Containers

Containers are the second type of compute. With containers, development teams can leverage Nitric with existing applications.

Nitric Containers are designed to support full-stack applications, microservices and monoliths. Your application code can also use the Nitric [APIs](/docs/reference/api) to support cloud portability.

Containers are specified in the Nitric stack definition:

```yaml
name: fees-micro-service

containers:
    orders-container:
    	context: .
        dockerfile: ./containers/springboot-fees-service.dockerfile
    	args:
      		HANDLER: target/fees-micro-service.jar
```

The Nitric CLI will automatically build stack dockerfiles, creating OCI Docker containers which incorporate the Nitric Membrane.

## Compute Architecture

Compute with Functions and custom Containers allows you to write code in a variety of popular languages and frameworks without needing to worry about servers, scaling, integrating with event/topic services, or managing the underlying runtime software.
