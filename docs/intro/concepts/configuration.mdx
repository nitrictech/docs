Nitric allows you to configure your stack or stacks via key-value pairs in the nitirc.yaml file associated with your stack. Below is a breakdown of the different features configurable within this file.

## Functions

Functions are deployable units of code that handle a single purpose, the Nitric stack file requires references (relative to your stack file) for each of your function's code via handlers.

```yaml
functions:
  create:
    handler: functions/create.ts
  read:
    handler: functions/read.ts
  list:
    handler: functions/list.ts
```

The function keys can be referenced in APIs and Entrypoints.

For more details see [Functions Reference](/docs/reference/project/functions)

## Containers

TODO

For more details see [Containers Reference](/docs/reference/project/containers)

## Collections

Document collections can be defined in the stack as follows:

```yaml
collections:
  customers: {}
```

This will create the collections if required during cloud deployment.

```
