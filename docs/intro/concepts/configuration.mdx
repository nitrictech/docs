Nitric allows you to defined your stack using a straight forward YAML configuration file. 

By default the Nitric configuration file is named `nitric.yaml`, but you can specify another name with the CLI `--file` option:

```bash
nitric --file myapp.yaml run
```

This topic provides a breakdown of all the Nitric features configured within this file.

## Functions

Functions are deployable units of code that handle a single purpose, the Nitric stack file requires references (relative to your stack file) for each of your function's code via handlers. 

In the example below we have 3 function keys named `create`, `read` and `list`. The function handlers define the application code to be invoked.

```yaml
functions:
  create:
    handler: functions/create.ts
  read:
    handler: functions/read.ts
  list:
    handler: functions/list.ts
```

The function name keys can be referenced in APIs and Entrypoints.

Functions can also be triggered by topic events. In the example below we have an `orders` topic, when a new item is published to this topic it will trigger the invocation of the `create-order` function.

```yaml
functions:
  create-order:
    handler: functions/create-order.ts
    triggers:
      topics:
        - orders

topics:
    orders: {}
```

For more details see [Functions Reference](/docs/reference/project/functions)

## Containers

Containers enable Nitric to deploy custom built Docker containers to the cloud, and be include in your Nitric stack.

In the example below the `express-orders.dockerfile` Dockerfile will be build and deployed by Nitric as part of the stack.

```
name: orders-rest-api

containers:
    orders-container:
        dockerfile: ./containers/express-orders.dockerfile
```

For more details see [Containers Reference](/docs/reference/project/containers)

## Collections

Document collections can be defined in the stack as follows:

```yaml
collections:
  customers: {}
  customers: {}
```

This will create the collections if required during cloud deployment.

## Entrypoints APIs

Nitric APIs are defined in a separate file for ease of use. The apis key used used to reference the file:

```yaml
apis:
  customers: api.yaml
```
